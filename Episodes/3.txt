301 INT. DUCTS - WHERE WE WERE AT THE END OF EPISODE 2 301
PANICKED BREATHING. DARKNESS. WATER RUSHING. Then: whir whir whir whir...
A SMALL, DIM LIGHT begins to fade up in the darkness, PULSING brighter and brighter with each whir whir whir...
     BEZPALOV - is holding a small hand-powered DYNO TORCH. With
     every squeeze, the light grows brighter... then starts to
     dim down...
BARANOV moves the DOSIMETER closer to the meager rising/ falling light. Then signals to Ananenko... look at this... but Ananenko shakes his head. Doesn't matter. Stay calm.
     whir whir whirwhirwhirwhirwhir
     Ananenko makes gentle movements now with his hand. To both
     of them. "Slow your breathing. Don't panic."
     whir... whir....    whir.......
     The three men wrestle with their fear. Control their
     breathing. Then Ananenko grabs Bezpalov by the wrist. Moves
     Bezpalov's free hand toward the back of his wetsuit.
Grab it.
Bezpalov grabs it. Then Baranov grabs on to him, so that all
     three are now holding on to each other.
     Ananenko holds his hand up to them. Makes a FIST. "Tight."
     They tighten their grips. If they let go... they are lost.
     whir whir whir whir...
     Bezpalov moves the dyno torch around so they can see:
     THE WALL OF THE DUCT.
     Water continues to slowly fill the space
     Ananenko moves slowly toward the wall... the two other men
     following along in a chain...
     When they get to the wall, Ananenko grabs hold of a PIPE.
     There are SIX pipes running along the wall. He counts
     down... first, second, third, fourth.
1.

     Fourth. That's the one that leads to the sluice gate. He
     begins FEELING HIS WAY forward, hand over hand, never losing
     contact with the fourth pipe...
     ...and the others follow in the near darkness.
     whir whir whir...
302 EXT. CHERNOBYL - VICINITY OF THE HATCH - SAME 302
     Pikalov, Shcherbina and Legasov stand waiting. No one says a
     word. Then Shcherbina checks his watch.
     Legasov says nothing. Just keeps staring at the hatch.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Is it possible the water has already
killed them?
Yes.
LEGASOV
                              SHCHERBINA
                  So then what?
                        (beat)
                  If it doesn't work?
     Legasov doesn't answer. Because there is no answer.
303 INT. DUCTS - SAME 303
     Dark. It's deeper here. And emerging from the pitch black...
     ...the three men. Holding tight to each other. Following
     that single pipe. Their only hope. The barest of light
     coming from Bezpalov, whose hand is getting tired.
     The pulsing of the torch is lower... lower...
     They get closer to us. Closer. Closer. Breathing louder.
     Water rising up to their WAIST. And then:
     A JARRING NOISE
     REVERSE TO SEE: in the darkness, Ananenko has walked right
     into the CLOSED SLUICE GATE. His MASK is knocked askew.
     BARANOV - moves quickly. Adjusts the mask back onto
     Baranov's face.
     whirwhirwhirwhirwhir
2.

     Breathe. You're okay. Look. We did it. We found the gate.
     On the sluice gate - TWO RUSTY WHEEL VALVES on either side.
     Ananenko wades to one. Bezpalov gives Baranov the dyno
     torch, and moves to the other.
     The valves look as if they have never been turned.
     If they can't open them, then this was for nothing. The men
     put their hands on the valves.
     Look at each other. And then: THEY PUT their all into it...
     and before we can even see if the wheels budge--
304 EXT. CHERNOBYL - VICINITY OF THE HATCH - LATER 304
     Shcherbina paces. Pikalov stares at the ground.
     Legasov stares silently at the hatch.
     And then: a noise... loud enough that it can be heard even
     from here. A heavy THUMP THUMP THUMP on the hatch.
     Soldiers rush over. Open the hatch.
     BEZPALOV emerges. Soaked from the waist down, and SHOUTING
     in triumph.
     The soldiers BURST into cheers and applause as Baranov and
     Ananenko follow Bezpalov out...
     Legasov, Shcherbina and Pikalov all slump with relief. They
     did it. Shcherbina motions to Pikalov, who immediately heads
     toward some military firemen.
                              PIKALOV
                  Bring the hoses in. Start pumping.
     Shcherbina CLAPS Legasov on the shoulder. Beaming.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Look. Look at our boys!
     ON THE THREE - surrounded by cheering soldiers. They look
     absolutely fine. Bezpalov takes a swig of vodka.
     It's a jubilant scene, but Legasov looks as if he's going to
     throw up.
                              LEGASOV
                  Get them to the doctors.
3.
  
     Legasov walks away. Shcherbina absorbs that, then looks back
     at the scene. The men continue to hug and congratulate the
     divers and each other, even as the military firefighters
     bring in the pump hoses...
     Ananenko catches sight of Shcherbina. The man who told him
     it must be done.
     The smile fades from Ananenko's face. Replaced with the
     simple pride of a man who knows he may have just given his
     life to his people.
     He raises a bottle to Shcherbina, and Shcherbina solemnly
     nods back.
305 EXT. NOVAYA BASMANAYA STREET - MOSCOW - AFTERNOON 305
     A large, imposing stone building set back from the street.
     Two stories, with tall windows in orderly rows.
     LYUDMILLA, the firefighter's wife, enters frame, carrying
     her dingy suitcase. A country mouse far from home.
     She stops in front of the building. Looks up at it. She's
     never felt so small or afraid in her life.
TITLE:
                            APRIL 30, 1986
                       HOSPITAL NUMBER 6, MOSCOW
306 INT. HOSPITAL NUMBER 6 - MOMENTS LATER 306
     Lyudmilla approaches the receptionist at the front desk.
     The receptionist, YENINA, 30, is filling out some paperwork.
     Lyudmilla just stands there, waiting silently.
     Finally, Yenina STAMPS the paperwork, removes her reading
     glasses, and:
Yes?
YENINA
Lyudmilla dutifully recites what the military officer told
her to say.
                         LYUDMILLA
             I'm here to see my husband, Vasily
             Ignatenko. He's a firefighter from
             Chernobyl. I have permission.
4.

                              YENINA
                  Chernobyl? I'm sorry. No visitors.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  But-- Major Burov, he told me-- he
said--
                              YENINA
                  No exceptions.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  Please-- I came all the way from
                  Kievskaya oblast...
     Yenina is unmoved. Just keeps staring.
     Lyudmilla puts her suitcase down, and opens her purse. Digs
     out some crumpled MONEY. Holds it out silently to the
     receptionist.
     Yenina looks at the money, then grabs a small slip of paper,
     selects a STAMP from her wheel, and-- TWHACK. Stamps a
     visitor's pass.
     She takes Lyudmilla's money, and hands her the pass.
307 INT. HALLWAY - RADIATION WING - MOMENTS LATER 307
     Lyudmilla walks down the hall with her suitcase and her
     stamped pass.
     She sees a DOCTOR, VETROVA, 30's, wearing a cloth face mask.
Excuse me?
LYUDMILLA
Vetrova turns. Surprised to see a visitor. She lowers her
face mask.
                         VETROVA
             Who are you? What are you doing up
here?
                         LYUDMILLA
             I have a pass.
                         VETROVA
             You can't be here. It's not safe.
Lyudmilla starts into her recitation.
5.

                         LYUDMILLA
             I'm here to see my husband, Vasily
             Ignatenko. He's a firefighter from--
                         VETROVA
             I know who Ignatenko is, but you
             can't.
Lyudmilla tries to hold back her tears. It's not working.
                         LYUDMILLA
             But I have permission. I have--
Lyudmilla opens her purse once more. There's not much left.
Vetrova realizes what Lyudmilla's doing. Oh god. She puts
her hand on Lyudmilla's. No need for that...
                         VETROVA
                   (reluctant)
             You can have thirty minutes with him.
             Not a minute more.
Lyudmilla, relieved, nods.
                         VETROVA
             And you cannot touch him. In any way.
             Do you understand?
                         LYUDMILLA
The doctor hesitates, then:
Yes.
Room 15.
VETROVA
                         LYUDMILLA
                   (overwhelmed)
             Thank you.
As Lyudmilla starts to walk down the hall--
                         VETROVA
             You're not pregnant, are you?
Lyudmilla stops. Turns back to the doctor.
                         LYUDMILLA
The doctor nods. Go on then.
No.
6.

308 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY / ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER 308
     Lyudmilla rounds a corner. Room 12... 13... 14... Room 15.
     She screws up her courage, and then pushes the door open.
     REVEAL: the FIREFIGHTERS... Vasily sitting up on one bed,
     Kibenok and Pravik sitting side-by-side on the other.
     Pravik is hooked up to an IV. And they're each in hospital
     pyjamas. Skin reddened, as if sunburned. But otherwise?
     They're fine. Playing cards, in fact. Pravik looks up.
                              PRAVIK
                  Look who the cat dragged in.
     Vasily sees Lyudmilla. A big grin breaks out on his face.
                              VASILY
                  What did I tell you? There's no
                  hiding from this woman...
     The firefighters laugh. Vasily rises as Lyudmilla drops her
     suitcase and RUSHES into his arms, hugging and kissing him
     as she weeps for joy.
                              VASILY
                  Ow ow... easy! Easy!
     She backs off slightly, but just keeps sobbing on him.
                              VASILY
                  It's okay. Shhh, Lyusya, shhh. I'm
                  okay. We're all okay...
     SOUND RISES: military drums, a massive crowd cheering, and:
309 EXT. RED SQUARE - MOSCOW - DAY [FILE FOOTAGE] 309
     FILE FOOTAGE - A bright, sunny days. Thousands of people.
     Red flags everywhere. Children in uniforms. Soldiers
     marching in formation. Trucks display nuclear missiles.

 TITLE:
        MAY 1, 1986
 INTERNATIONAL LABOUR DAY
5 DAYS AFTER THE EXPLOSION

310 INT. GARANIN'S OFFICE - MINSK - SAME 310
     Garanin is on the phone. Through the window, we hear the
     cheering of PEOPLE on the street.
                              GARANIN
                  Yes, the parade's already begun. All
                  of Minsk is out on the street, which
                  is why I felt it was--
(beat)
Of course not-- but the wind has been blowing in from the southeast since early morning. From Kiev. From Cherno-- no, no... but if we were to cancel now, just as a precaution-- I understand, but then perhaps we should issue iodine tablets to--
     He's been cut off again. Then, defeated:
                              GARANIN
                  Yes. Certainly you're right. It was
                  foolish of me to call. I apologize.
                  Thank you for your wisdom, Minister.
                  Please-- enjoy the 100th anniversary
                  of International Workers' Day.
     Garanin places the phone receiver back on the cradle. Then
     walks to the window. We can't see the parade. We can only
     see him watching helplessly.
     He picks up his jacket, which is covered in civilian
     MEDALS-- the ceremonial finery of a Party leader. He puts it
     on, buttons it, straightens it, takes a breath--
     --and heads out to join the parade.
311 OMITTED 311
312 INT. MILITARY HELICOPTER - DAY 312
     Mid-flight. A RADIOMETRIC CREW is in the back. Full
     protective suits. The door is open, and they're holding
     RADIOMETERS out to sample the smoky air.
     We hear the telltale CRACKLE of a GEIGER COUNTER... and as
     the helicopter washes through a PLUME OF SMOKE, the clicking
     suddenly explodes into DEAFENING STATIC...
8.

313 EXT. REACTOR SITE - SAME 313
     The helicopter is CIRCLING above the destroyed reactor.
     TITLE:
MAY 2, 1986
314 EXT. REACTOR SITE - LATER 314
     Trailers have been set up near the site as mobile offices. A
     web of FIRE HOSES extend out from the ruins toward Pikalov's
     specialized military fire trucks, each with pumps running.
     FLOOD LIGHTS have been set up to illuminate the work area.
     Men move back and forth, some wearing gas masks. Others not.
     PIKALOV - talks with one of the radiometrists who was on the
     helicopter. Then walks back to:
     LEGASOV and SHCHERBINA - who stand over a workbench covered
     in maps. They're mid-argument.
                              LEGASOV
                  How did this happen? Who gave them
this idea?
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Are you suggesting I did?
                              LEGASOV
                  Well someone decided the evacuation
                  zone should be thirty kilometers,
                  when we know--
                        (points to the map)
                  Here! Caesium-137 in Gomel District.
                  Two HUNDRED kilometers away!
     Pikalov waits. Uncomfortable. Clearly has information to
     share, but doesn't want to interrupt.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  It was decided.
                              LEGASOV
                  Based on WHAT?
                              SHCHERBINA
                  I don't know.
9.
  
                         LEGASOV
                   (disbelief)
             Forgive me. Maybe I've spent too much
             time in my lab. Or maybe I'm stupid.
             But is this really how it all works?
             An uninformed, arbitrary decision
             that will cost who knows how many
             lives is made by some apparatchik?
             Some career Party man?
                         SHCHERBINA
                   (angered)
             I am a career Party man. You should
             mind your tone, Comrade Legasov.
Legasov stares oddly at Shcherbina. Wasn't expecting that
defense. It almost seemed... calculated.
                         PIKALOV
                   (ahem)
             Comrades.
They turn to him. He's holding a piece of paper in his hand.
                         PIKALOV
             We have visual confirmation that the
             fire is nearly extinguished. There
             has also been a reduction in iodine-
             131 and caesium-137 emissions.
Good.
SHCHERBINA
                   (to Legasov)
             Yes?
                         PIKALOV
             But the temperature is rising. And--
He trails off. Then simply hands the paper to Legasov. It's a SPECTROGRAPH. Legasov stares at the chart for a moment.
                         LEGASOV
             There's a spike in zirconium-95. It's
             from the cladding on the fuel rods.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Which means what?
                         LEGASOV
             We use zirconium to contain the
             uranium because its melting point is
so high.

10.
 
                              LEGASOV (cont'd)
                  A graphite fire alone isn't hot
                  enough to vaporise it. It's the fuel
                  itself.
                        (beat)
                  The meltdown has begun.
     The sound of a HELICOPTER buzzing by. The air churns up DUST
     from the ground, and we DISSOLVE TO:
315 INT. THE REACTOR - NOW 315
     AN EMPTY WATER BASIN - puddles of dark water, rust marks on
     the walls, and extending down from the ceiling, a large
     DRAINAGE PIPE, like an upside-down T.
     We hold for a moment. Then a thin line of dark MAGMA drips
     out of drain... dangles in the air, then hits the ground
     with a SIZZLE.
     Another line from the other opening. And then, without
     warning:
     A HUGE MASS of CORIUM POURS OUT AND DOWN - from both sides
     of the drainpipe - thick, deadly lava, bubbling and POOLING
     with a SIZZLE on the concrete below...
     We're watching a nuclear reactor core melting down. This is
     what it looks like. Hypnotic, and almost beautiful.
     Almost.
     We hear the concrete CRACKLING, and we cut to:
316 INT. HALLWAY - RADIATION WING -HOSPITAL NO.6 - NIGHT 316
     Drip... drip... drip...
     A small, rusty DRINKING FOUNTAIN drips. Each drip echoing
     slightly in the:
EMPTY HOSPITAL HALLWAY - where Lyudmilla sits in a chair. Sleeping. No sound but the low buzz of the fluorescent lights, and drip... drip... drip...
     And then a low moan from off screen.
     Lyudmilla shifts a bit. Troubled sleep.
     Another moan. Another. Then a man SCREAMING in pain.
11.

     Lyudmilla instantly wakes. It's silent in the hallway again.
     Was that a dream?
     Another SCREAM. Louder. She leaps to her feet, and:
317 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 15 / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 317
     Lyudmilla enters the room. Two nurses are attending to
     Vasily, blocking Lyudmilla's view of him.
     The other two beds are EMPTY, save for BLOOD STAINS on both
     of them.
     The nurses are clearly struggling.
                              HOSPITAL 6 NURSE
                  You have to stop moving. We can't get
                  the needle in if you don't stop
                  moving.
     His screaming is terrible. Lyudmilla moves towards the
     nurses, panicked.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  You're hurting him!
     She pulls at one of the nurses, and sees:
     VASILY - covered in LESIONS. His face, his arms, his neck...
     everywhere there is skin, there are tiny open SORES, some
     bleeding, some coated in weeping pus.
     Vasily writhes in AGONY as the other nurse attempts to hold
     him down by his burning skin in order to inject morphine.
     Lyudmilla can only stare in horror.
                              HOSPITAL 6 NURSE
                  You can't be in here.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  What's happening to him...?
     Vasily SCREAMS again.
                              HOSPITAL 6 NURSE
                  YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!
     The nurse PUSHES Lyudmilla out of the room, and then heads
     back to help her colleague.
12.

     Lyudmilla stands alone in the hallway, helpless, listening
     to her husband screaming... as if he's been set on fire...
     We hold on her listening until it's too much to bear, and:
318 INT. KREMLIN CONF. ROOM / INT. COMMAND ROOM - NIGHT 318
     Gorbachev's grim face.
ON HIS DESK in the corner of the room - seven newspapers from major Western nations. On each one, a stapled translation. They're all about the same thing. Chernobyl.
     The PHONE RINGS. He answers.
GORBACHEV
                  Put them through.
(beat) Well?
     INTERCUT WITH: Shcherbina on the phone in the command suite
     at the Polissya. Legasov next to him, on a second handset.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  The graphite fire is nearly out, and
                  the bubbler tanks are being drained.
                  We have successfully eliminated the
                  risk of thermal explosion.
Gorbachev slowly exhales. Then realizes Shcherbina has fallen quiet on the other end.
Yes.
(beat)
And?
GORBACHEV
            SHCHERBINA
The situation inside the core is
deteriorating faster than
anticipated. The concrete pad will
hold for 6 to 8 weeks, but after
that, Legasov estimates a 50% chance
the fuel will breach the pad and melt
down into the groundwater itself.
            GORBACHEV
And where does that groundwater go?
            SHCHERBINA
The Pripyat River, which feeds into
the Dnieper.
            (MORE)
13.

                         SHCHERBINA (cont'd)
             The primary water supply for
             approximately fifty million people--
             not to mention crops and livestock--
             would be... unusable.
Gorbachev closes his eyes. Can't take it anymore.
But:
            SHCHERBINA
We are recommending we install a heat
exchanger under the pad to lower the
core temperature and halt the
meltdown. In order to do this, I'm
told we'll need all of the liquid
nitrogen in the Soviet Union.
            GORBACHEV
      (long pause, then)
Alright.
            SHCHERBINA
And of course, we'll need--
            GORBACHEV
Whatever you need, you have it. That
should be clear by now. Is there
anything else?
            SHCHERBINA
My apologies. No. Thank you for--
            LEGASOV
Yes. I wanted to address the 30
14.
              kilometer exclusion zone--
Shcherbina reacts. What does Legasov think he's doing?
                         GORBACHEV
             What exclusion zone? Is that Legasov?
             What are you-- ?
                         SHCHERBINA
                   (jumping in quickly)
             Minor details, General Secretary.
             Premier Ryzhkov has determined that--
                         GORBACHEV
                   (angry)
             If he determined, then he determined.
Shcherbina glares at Legasov. Idiot.

                              GORBACHEV
                  Legasov, you are there for one
                  purpose, do you understand? To make
                  this stop. I don't want questions. I
                  want to know when this will be over.
                              LEGASOV
                  If you mean, when will Chernobyl be
                  completely safe, the half-life of
                  Plutonium-239 is 24,000 years.
                        (beat)
                  Perhaps we should just say, "Not
                  within our lifetimes."
     A stunned Gorbachev hangs on the phone for a few silent
     moments... and then slowly hangs up. Then:
                              SHCHERBINA
                  I think you and I should take a walk.
                              LEGASOV
                        (wary)
                  It's late. I'm tired.
                              SHCHERBINA
                        (not negotiable)
                  We're taking a walk.
319 EXT. PRIPYAT - STREET - NIGHT 319
     A DOG walks steadily, tail wagging. Happy. A bit of SAUSAGE
     sails into frame, and the dog snatches it out of the air.
     Now another DOG enters frame. Then a CAT.
     REVEAL: Shcherbina and Legasov walking down the abandoned
     city street. Street lamps shining for no one.
     As they go, Shcherbina casually rips pieces of a large
     kolbasa and tosses them back to the left-behind pets, a
     dozen of whom follow him like he's some kind of Pied Piper.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Would you like some kolbasa?
                              LEGASOV
                        (enough with this)
                  What is it you want? An apology? I
                  won't sit back and let these people--
                              SHCHERBINA
                  What's going to happen to our boys?
15.
  
                         LEGASOV
             What boys? The divers?
                         SHCHERBINA
             The divers, the firefighters, the men
             in the control room. What does the
             radiation do to them? Precisely.
Legasov doesn't want to answer this question. But:
                         LEGASOV
             At the levels some of them were
             exposed to... ionizing radiation
             tears the cellular structure apart.
             The skin blisters, turns red, then
             dark. There's nausea, dizziness,
             fever, loss of consciousness.
Shcherbina throws the last of the sausage into the night,
and the pets chase after it, disappearing into the
dark.
Continue.
SHCHERBINA
            LEGASOV
This is followed by a latency period.
The immediate effects subside. The
patients appear to be recovering.
Healthy, even. But they aren't.
They arrive at a bench. Shcherbina sits. Legasov joins him.
                         SHCHERBINA
                   (calmly, again)
Continue.
                         LEGASOV
             This lasts for only a day or two.
             Then the cellular damage begins to
             manifest. The bone marrow dies, the
             immune system fails, and the soft
             tissue and organs begin to decompose.
             The arteries and veins spill open
             like sieves, to the point where you
             can't even administer morphine for
             the pain, which is-- unimaginable.
             And within three days to three weeks,
             you are dead. That is what will
             happen to those boys.
Shcherbina takes it in. Then:
16.

                         SHCHERBINA
             Strange. How the things we can't see
             are the most dangerous.
                   (beat)
             And what about us?
                         LEGASOV
             We've gotten a steady dose, but much
             less of it. Not strong enough to kill
             the cells, but consistent enough to
             damage the DNA. In time... cancer. Or
             aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Well. In a sense, it would seem we've
             gotten off easily then... Valery.
His first name. Legasov notes the familiarity. The kind between friends. A moment between them, and then Shcherbina just barely nods his head to the left.
Was that a signal? Legasov glances back down the street in
the direction of Shcherbina's nod, and sees:
THIRTY METERS BEHIND THEM - a MAN AND WOMAN under a street
lamp. Clearly following from a distance.
But not just any man and woman. The "husband and wife" from
the bar. The wife who asked Legasov if there were anything
to worry about.
They don't seem worried now at all. Nor do they seem like a husband and wife. They just stare back at Legasov.
Dead-eyed. Expressionless. And above all, no attempt to disguise who they truly are.
Legasov turns back to look straight ahead. Terrified. My god... that night... he almost told them what he knew...
Shcherbina resumes walking. Legasov moves with him. Stiffly.
Trying not to look back.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Now you know why I wanted to take a
             walk. Obviously the work site is
             bugged. But I suspect our rooms as
             well. Even our bathrooms. They say
             you haven't taken a proper shit until
             you've done it in front of the KGB.
And now Legasov understands the reason for Shcherbina's
impassioned defense of the Soviet state.
17.
    
                              LEGASOV
                  I've seen them before. They've been
                  here the whole time.
     Shcherbina sighs. Legasov is a smart man, and yet so stupid.
SHCHERBINA
Of course they've been here the whole
                  time. If we're seeing them out in the
                  open now-- it's because they want us
                  to know.
     Legasov glances back one more time at the man and woman. But
     keeps walking along with Shcherbina.
     And the pets... and the KGB... keep following.
320 INT. POLISSYA HOTEL - LOBBY BAR - NIGHT 320
     Legasov, returning, crosses through the now-abandoned lobby,
     then sees:
     KHOMYUK alone at the lobby bar, papers spread out around
     her. Scribbling calculations. A bottle of vodka and a glass.
     He hesitates. Makes a silent decision. Then crosses over and
     takes a seat near her at the bar.
     She glances up at him from her work, then eyes back down to
     her calculations. But she slides a spectrograph page over to
     him from the top of her papers. Keeps her eyes on her work
     as she talks.
                              KHOMYUK
                  You've seen that? The fuel is melting
                  faster than we expected. The pad--
                              LEGASOV
                  I know. I have a plan.
                              KHOMYUK
                  Heat exchanger, I hope.
LEGASOV
                  Yes.
                        (her equations)
                  There's something I've wanted to ask
                  you, Comrade. But I see you've been
                  asking it yourself.
     She finally slams her pencil down. Beyond frustrated. The
     anger of a relentless mind facing an unsolvable puzzle.
18.

            KHOMYUK
Why did it explode. I've worked the
numbers over and over, presuming the
worst possible conditions in an RBMK
reactor, and I get the same answer
every time.
LEGASOV
KHOMYUK
19.
              Which is?
             It's not possible.
LEGASOV
             And yet.
They sit in silence for a moment. Then:
                         LEGASOV
             I've spoken to the director of your
             institute. He says you're difficult
             and brutally stubborn.
                   (beat)
             Which I'm hoping for.
He takes her page of calculations.
                         LEGASOV
             You're not going to solve this here.
Not on paper.
She leans forward. Activated. Yes... a hunt. A chase. For the truth.
                         LEGASOV
             I'm authorizing you to conduct a full
             inquiry. Begin in Moscow. Hospital
             Number 6. Talk to everyone who was in
             the control room that night--
             Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov-- we need
             to know exactly what occurred. Moment
             by moment, decision by decision. No
             detail is too small. Go now. While
             they're still alive. Because if we do
             not find out how this happened-- then
             it will happen again.
Understood. Feeling the thrill of the chase, she gathers her
papers and rises to leave. Then:
                         LEGASOV
             And Khomyuk...
   
     She turns back. He makes a subtle gesture around himself, as
     in-- "the system around us is watching... listening..."
                              LEGASOV
                  Be careful.
And we see a twinge in her now. Asking questions and seeking truth in the Soviet Union is a dangerous game. She nods stiffly to him, and exits.
     We hear BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER now, and cut to:
321 EXT. COAL MINES - TULA, RUSSIA - DAY 321
A group of forty-five MINERS on break. Vodka. Cigarettes. Behind them, conveyor belts and hoppers. Bulldozers and dust. Rolling hills pierced by cart tracks.
     These men are hard. Blackened faces. Blackened lungs. Young
     and old. Thick bellies. Tough muscle. But right now...
                              OLD MINER
                  Wait wait I have one, I have one...
                  so every Friday, Maxim The Factory
                  Guard sees Yaroslav The Worker coming
                  out of the factory with a wheelbarrow
                  full of hay. And each time, Maxim
                  looks through the hay to see what
                  Yaroslav's stealing, but he never
                  finds anything. They do this for
                  thirty years until Maxim says,
                  "Yaroslav, I'm retiring. It's my last
                  day. I promise-- I won't tell anyone,
                  but I have to know. What have you
                  been stealing?" And Yaroslav says--
     The other miners all shout back at him.
                              THE MINERS
                  "I've been stealing the
                  wheelbarrows!"
     They all break out laughing, except for the miner who was
     telling the joke.
                              OLD MINER
                  Oh, fuck off all of you...
     GLUKHOV, 40, short and stocky-- a fire hydrant of a man--
     waves his hand to get their attention. His turn.
20.

                              GLUKHOV
                  Okay okay, here's one-- what's as big
                  as a house, burns 20 liters of fuel
                  an hour, puts out a huge amount of
                  smoke and noise, and cuts an apple
                  into three pieces?
                        (beat)
                  A Soviet machine for cutting apples
                  into four pieces.
     The men explode with laughter. Except for:
                              OLD MINER
                  That's bullshit! It's not even
funny...!
     But the miners keep laughing. And Glukhov is laughing the
     loudest at his own joke, until he sees:
     TWO MILITARY TROOP TRANSPORT TRUCKS approaching in the
     distance, led by a BLACK SEDAN with a small Soviet FLAG on
     the hood. His smile fades. And now they all turn to see it.
     One of the miners SPITS in disgust at the sight of the car.
     Glukhov rises and starts walking out to meet their unwelcome
     guests. The rest of the miners follow, like a gang on their
     way to a rumble.
322 INT. TROOP TRANSPORT TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 322
     DRIVER'S POV - looking through the windshield of the lead
     bus as it follows the sedan into the mining facility. Wipers
     on to keep the COAL DUST from settling like snow.
     And ahead... nearly four dozen angry men... waiting.
323 EXT. COAL MINES - CONTINUOUS 323
     The sedan comes to a stop. The driver gets out, walks around
     to the passenger side, and opens the door for:
     MIKHAIL SHADOV, 40's, ugly pale-blue suit. He emerges,
     already intimidated by the hardass miners glaring at him. So
     he puffs himself up. Opts for his most authoritative voice.
                              SHADOV
                  Who is in charge here?
                              GLUKHOV
                  I'm the crew chief.
21.

Shadov makes a show of taking a NOTEPAD and PEN from his coat.
                         SHADOV
             I am Shadov. Minister of Coal
Industries.
                         GLUKHOV
             We know who you are.
And they clearly don't care. This isn't working. Don't let them see you sweat. Shadov tries again. Louder.
                         SHADOV
             How many men work here?
                         GLUKHOV
             Forty-five on this shift. One hundred
total.
                         SHADOV
             I need all one hundred men to gather
             their equipment and get on the buses.
                         GLUKHOV
             Do you? To where?
TWO SOLDIERS have emerged from the troop transport trucks,
each holding an AK-47. They're young. Shadov glances at
them, then turns back to the miners. Renewed confidence.
                         SHADOV
             That's classified.
The miners look at each other. This could get ugly. But
Glukhov isn't worried. He's looking at the soldiers.
                         GLUKHOV
             Go ahead. Start shooting. You don't
             have enough bullets for all of us.
             Kill as many as you can, whoever's
             left over will beat the piss out of
             each of you.
Shadov deflates. Knows he's lost. But one of the soldiers...
                         YOUNG SOLDIER
             You can't talk to us like--
                         GLUKHOV
             Shut the fuck up.
The soldier shuts the fuck up. Now he knows he's lost too.
Shadov and the soldiers stand chastened, like school boys.
22.

                         GLUKHOV
             This is Tula. This is our mine. We
             don't leave unless you tell us why.
Defeated, Shadov considers the men before him. "Classified"
be damned. All he can do now is tell them the truth. He puts
his notepad and pen back in his coat.
                         SHADOV
             You are going to Chernobyl.
Glukhov stares at him. Stunned. They all are.
                         SHADOV
             You know what's happened there?
                         GLUKHOV
             We dig up coal. Not bodies.
                         SHADOV
             The reactor fuel is going to sink
             into the ground and poison the water
             from Kiev to the Black Sea. All of
             it. Forever, they say. They want you
             to stop that from happening.
The miners whisper to each other. Can that be true?
                         GLUKHOV
             And how are we supposed to do that?
                         SHADOV
             They didn't tell me, because I don't
             need to know. Do you need to know? Or
             have you heard enough?
Glukhov sucks his teeth. Thinks. Then turns back to his men.
Well? The Old Miner lifts his head.
                         OLD MINER
             Who, if not us?
Glukhov nods. Then slowly walks up to Shadov... pats his
DIRTY HAND on Shadov's shoulder, getting the Minister's blue
suit all sooty...
...and heads toward the truck. Shadov barely has time to see
the mess Glukhov's made of him when: THE REST OF THE MINERS
slowly parade past him toward the trucks--
--each one making sure to PAT Shadov on the shoulder... the
chest... the belly... covering him in BLACK COAL DUST.
23.
   
     As the OLD MINER walks by, he gives Shadov a very friendly,
     and very sooty, PAT ON THE CHEEK.
                              OLD MINER
                  Now you look like the Minister of
                  Coal...
     The miners laugh, and we cut to:
324 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 15 - DARK 324
     CLOSE ON: Lyudmilla, sitting in a chair in the dark room. A
     vigil. From just off-camera, we can hear rattling breaths.
REVEAL: Vasily Ignatenko in his hospital bed. Barely recognizable. His hair is gone. Eyebrows too. His skin is covered in strange, discolored patches... red, green and blue bruising, as if he had been beaten.
     His body is swollen.
     His lips are split open in places, and covered in a thick,
     white plaque.
     He is 25-years old. He looks so much older.
     And all she can do is watch him sleep.
     Until-- he stops breathing.
LYUDMILLA
                  Vasya?
     And then: he draws in a sharp breath.
     Thank god. She leans over and kisses him on his forehead. He
     opens his eyes. Groans. Frustrated.
                              VASILY
                  They told you no touching. It's not
safe.
LYUDMILLA
They touch you. If it's safe for them
                  it's safe for me.
     She reaches for a cup of water with a straw. He shakes his
     head. No. Then:
                              VASILY
                  How are the others?
24.
   
                         LYUDMILLA
             They took them to a special room.
             They won't tell me where.
He doesn't respond. Then:
                         VASILY
             Open the curtains.
She sets the cup down and crosses to the window behind him.
Pulls the curtain aside. BRIGHT DAYLIGHT floods in.
Vasily instantly closes his eyes in pain. Lyudmilla quickly
returns to his side, and places special, bandaged DARKENED
LENSES gently over his eyes.
He waits for the pain to subside. Then...
                         VASILY
             What do you see? Tell me everything.
She turns slowly back to the window. From here, the only
view is a dismal array of brutally ugly apartment buildings,
and a grim highway just beyond.
                         LYUDMILLA
             I see the Red Square from here. The
             Kremlin, the Mausoleum, Spasskaya
             Tower...
He nods. Pleased.
                         VASILY
             Saint Basil's?
                         LYUDMILLA
             Yes. It's beautiful.
                         VASILY
             You see? I told you I'd show you
             Moscow one day. I told you.
She walks back to him. Sits down. Gently takes his hand. The
flesh hangs strangely from his bones, as if it's separating.
                         LYUDMILLA
             Thank you, my love.
BEHIND HER - through the interior window facing the hospital
hallway, we see a figure in PROTECTIVE GEAR passing by...
25.

325 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 325
     KHOMYUK strides down the hallway in medical clothing. Rubber
     gloves. Rubber booties. Sleeves and pants cuffs tucked in.
     In her hand, a notebook and pen. She stops in front of a
     door, then takes a breath, and raises a cloth face-mask in
     place to cover her nose and mouth.
     She opens the door.
     INSIDE THE HOSPITAL ROOM - a man stands in a hospital gown,
     his back to us, staring out the window. He turns slowly at
     the sound of the door.
     It's DYATLOV. His hair is now missing in patches. His
     eyebrows are gone. But otherwise-- he seems oddly fine. No
     trace of the morphine delirium we saw before.
     He gestures to an uneaten tray of food. Contemptous.
                              DYATLOV
                  I'm not eating that. It's shit. Bring
                  me something else.
                              KHOMYUK
                  I'm not a nurse, Comrade Dyatlov. I'm
a nuclear physicist. Oh really? Her? A sneer, then:
                              DYATLOV
                  Well then, Comrade Nuclear Physicist,
                  unless you happen to have a butter
                  and caviar sandwich with you, you can
                  get the fuck out of my room.
     And with that, he turns away.
326 EXT. REACTOR SITE - DAY 326
     BUSES pull up to the site, just fifty meters or so away from
     the blown-open reactor building.
     The miners get out... and stare in shock at the sight in
     front of them. Soldiers hand out GAS MASKS to them as they
     file off the bus.
                              MINER
                  Where do we need to go?
26.

                              SOLDIER
                  Straight ahead.
     The miners stumble forward. This is far from a mine. They're
     unsure what they're doing or where they're supposed to be.
327 INT. MOBILE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 327
     Legasov sits with Shcherbina. A map of the power plant on
     the small table in front of them.
Legasov smokes. Worried.
             What.
SHCHERBINA
            LEGASOV
I'm not good at this, Boris.
      (beat)
The lying.
            SHCHERBINA
Have you ever spent time with miners?
No.
LEGASOV
                         SHCHERBINA
             My advice? Tell the truth. These men
             work in the dark. They see
             everything.
A KNOCK on the door, then it opens. A soldier, announcing--
                         SOLDIER
             Andrei Glukhov. Crew chief.
Shcherbina nods. The soldier backs away, and GLUKHOV enters,
gas mask in hand. He sits himself down unceremoniously, and
drops the gas mask on the table. Gestures at it.
                         GLUKHOV
             Do these work?
                         LEGASOV
             To an extent.
Glukhov shrugs. Better than nothing. Then points at
Legasov's pack of cigarettes.
Of course.
LEGASOV
27.

He holds the cigarettes out to Glukhov, who casually takes
the entire pack. Lights one up, pockets the rest for later.
                         GLUKHOV
             Well? What's the job?
Legasov clears his throat. All right. He points to the map.
                         LEGASOV
             We need to install a liquid nitrogen
             heat exchanger underneath this
             concrete pad. There's no way to
             approach it from the interior of the
             building. We have to come at it from
             underground.
                         GLUKHOV
             And what's above the pad?
Again, right to the point. Legasov glances at Shcherbina,
who gives a tiny nod. "Tell the truth."
                         LEGASOV
             The core of the nuclear reactor,
             which is melting down.
                         GLUKHOV
                   (melting down?)
             What. Like-- ?
He makes a dropping gesture.
                         LEGASOV
             Essentially.
                         GLUKHOV
             Is it going to fall on us?
                         LEGASOV
             Not if you're done within six weeks.
Glukhov takes a long drag on his cigarette. Staring
carefully at Legasov. Then:
                         GLUKHOV
             Dimensions?
                         LEGASOV
                   (points at the map)
             You'll break ground here, tunnel 150
             metres to here, and then excavate
             a 30 metre by 30 metre space for the
             heat exchanger.
(MORE)
28.

                         LEGASOV (cont'd)
                   (beat)
             And because we need to keep
             disruption of the ground to a
             minimum, we cannot use heavy
             equipment. It must be done by hand.
Glukhov whistles. That's a big job.
                         GLUKHOV
             We'll need more men. At least four
             hundred. And we'll have to work
             around the clock.
                   (beat)
             How deep do you want this tunnel? Six
             metres?
            LEGASOV
            GLUKHOV
            LEGASOV
For your protection. At that depth,
you will be shielded from much of the
radiation.
            GLUKHOV
The entrance to the tunnel won't be
twelve metres down.
Twelve.
Twelve? Why?
No.
LEGASOV
                         GLUKHOV
             And we're not twelve metres down
right now.
                         LEGASOV
             No. We're not.
Ah. So this is the situation.
                         SHCHERBINA
             We have some equipment here on site,
             but more will arrive by midnight. You
             can start in the morning.
Glukhov stubs out his cigarette. Rises. Grabs his gas mask
off the table.
29.

                              GLUKHOV
                  We'll start now. I don't want my men
                  here one second more than they have
                  to be.
     He stares at his gas mask for a moment.
                              GLUKHOV
                  If these worked, you'd be wearing
                  them.
     He tosses the gas mask back on the table, and exits.
CUT TO:
328 NEAR PITCH BLACK 328
     The sound of muffled men shouting to each other. A heavy
     RATTLE of metal...
TITLE:
MAY 6, 1986
     And then a MINER shifts his head to UNBLOCK the lights
     behind him, and now we see him and a coworker PUSHING a MINE
     CART full of dirt around a CORNER and--
329 EXT. REACTOR SITE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 329
     They EMERGE from the MOUTH of the tunnel shaft, and quickly
     TILT the minecart to empty the dirt.
     They wear simple white uniforms, and simple white caps, much
     in the style of the reactor control room workers. But these
     men are covered in dirt. And dripping in sweat.
     There is a SIGN nailed to the side of the shaft entrance...
     yellow Cyrillic lettering on a piece of brown plywood.
SUBTITLE: Comrades: our goal, 24/7, is to advance the tunnel by 13 metres each day
     GLUKHOV emerges from the tunnel, right behind them. Jumps up
     out of the entrance trench.
                              GLUKHOV
                  Quickly. Back in. You two! Behind
30.
  them.
(MORE)

                         GLUKHOV (cont'd)
                   (to another miner)
             Iosif, get another spool of wire, and
             tell group three to switch with two.
They move quickly, and without care. Jumping down into the
dirt. Wiping the sweaty dust from their faces. No one is
wearing a mask.
Glukhov looks up at the SUN. It's beating down, and it's not
even noon yet.
He walks over to a crude, brown INTERCOM BOX set on top of some SANDBAGS. Pushes a button on it twice. It emits two signal tones. Bweee bwee... then we hear a VOICE, crackling through the tiny speaker.
Yes?
MINER (INTERCOM)
            GLUKHOV
What is it up to?
Fifty.
MINER (INTERCOM)
Glukhov hangs his head in frustration. Then sees:
                         GLUKHOV
             Hey. HEY, you!
PIKALOV, issuing commands to his radiometrists, looks over
to see: this short, angry miner MARCHING toward him.
                         GLUKHOV
             We need fans. Thirty or forty.
                         PIKALOV
             For what purpose?
                         GLUKHOV
             What do you mean? What purpose? To
             dig your fucking tunnel, what else?
One of Pikalov's men reacts, angrily, but Glukhov jabs his
finger in the air at the soldier.
                         GLUKHOV
             Who's talking to you? Who?
Pikalov raises a hand. Gets in between them.
Comrades--
PIKALOV
31.

                              GLUKHOV
                        (back to Pikalov)
It's 50 degrees down there. We can't breathe with the masks, we can't breathe without the masks. It's an oven. We need ventilation.
                              PIKALOV
                  Fans will put dust in the air. The
                  dust will go in your lungs.
                              GLUKHOV
                  I've been filling my lungs with dust
                  for twenty years.
                              PIKALOV
                  Not this dust. I'm sorry. But for
                  your own good-- no fans.
     Pikalov and his men walk away, leaving a frustrated Glukhov.
     We LOWER DOWN - INTO THE EARTH itself... until we come to:
330 INT. THE TUNNEL - NOW 330
     A cramped shaft, dimly lit by bulb strung along swales of
     electrical cord.
     Five miners are jammed against each other like rats in a
     nest, stooped over in the low tunnel, PICKING and SHOVELING
     into the earth as fast as they can manage.
     The heat is intense. Rippling the air in spots. They drip
     sweat, but they keep working.
     Gritting teeth. Muscles burning. And even without fans, the
     DUST swirls around them... it SHIMMERS in front of the
     lights... and we can literally see them inhaling it...
     A miner swings his PICK right at us, and we cut to:
331 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 331
     LEONID TOPTUNOV, the young control room engineer, lies in a
     bed. Most of his hair is gone. Bits of his mustache remain
     in small patches. His body looks just as bad as Ignatenko's.
     Discolored. Swollen. Thousand yard stare.
     He barely glances as KHOMYUK enters the room. Then back to
     the thousand yard stare.
32.
 
She moves the chair back a few feet from his bed to maintain
a safer distance, and sits. Still in full protection, mask
covering her mouth. Notebook open in her lap. Pen poised.
She hesitates. Difficult to interrogate someone who is dying
in front of your eyes. But no choice.
                         KHOMYUK
             My name is Ulana Khomyuk. I am a
             nuclear physicist working with the
             Chernobyl Commission. I want you to
             tell me everything that happened the
             night of the accident. Is that all
             right?
                         TOPTUNOV
                   (hurts to speak)
             Yes. I want to tell.
                         KHOMYUK
                   (reluctantly)
             Alright. Your official title was--
                         TOPTUNOV
                   (a strange pride)
             My name is Leonid Fedorovych
             Toptunov. I am the Senior Reactor
             Control Chief Engineer at Chernobyl
             Nuclear Power Plant.
She stops writing. Surprised.
                         KHOMYUK
             Senior engineer? How old are you?
He slowly turns his head to face her.
I'm 25.
TOPTUNOV
And now BLOOD begins leaking from his nostrils. Steady
rivulets... coming out too easily. Coming out too thin.
Khomyuk crosses to the bedside table, picks up some cotton
gauze, leans over Toptunov, and presses it gently to his
nose.
They're looking straight at each other.
Her face covered by a mask. His face covered by the gauze.
Nothing revealed but eyes gazing into eyes.
33.

332 EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 332
The long hallway - then a BLOND MAN steps into view. 30's, mustache. Rolling a sucking candy around in his mouth. He looks around. Oddly out of place, and yet zero emotion.
     Just a dead look. It should be quite clear what he is.
     He steps out of the way as ORDERLIES come by, wheeling a
     GURNEY - with VASILY, the dark lenses shielding his eyes
     from the light. Lyudmilla follows right behind.
     We move WITH THEM, leaving the Blond Man behind.
                              VASILY
                        (scared)
Lyusya...?
I'm here.
LYUDMILLA
They round a corner, and move toward a single room at the
end of the hallway. Double doors.
VETROVA emerges from the room. Visible behind her, in the
center of the room, we see heavy, CLEAR PLASTIC SHEETING
dangling in overlapping strips from the ceiling.
As the orderlies bring Vasily into the room, Vetrova STOPS
Lyudmilla from following. Shocked to even see her.
                         VETROVA
             Have you been here this whole time?
                         LYUDMILLA
             No one said I should leave.
                         VETROVA
             I did. Thirty minutes, I said!
                         LYUDMILLA
                   (anger)
             Well where have you been? When he's
             in pain? When his sores stick to his
             gown? When he soils himself five
             times a night-- I've been taking care
             of him. Where have you been?
Vetrova draws on every ounce of calm she has.
34.
 
                         VETROVA
             I have been in the north and west
             wing where there are dozens of
             patients from Chernobyl, exactly like
             him. It isn't safe for you here.
                         LYUDMILLA
             He's my husband.
                         VETROVA
             Not anymore. He's something else now.
             Do you understand? He's dangerous to
             you.
Lyudmilla doesn't understand. Or pretends not to?
                         LYUDMILLA
             He's burned.
Vetrova can only shake her head. Tired. No, exhausted.
35.
  Go home.
VETROVA
     All the fight leaves Lyudmilla, and she regresses to an
     almost child-like desperation and fear.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  Please. It won't be much longer.
                        (can barely say it)
                  I don't want him to die alone.
     Vetrova closes her eyes. Angry at herself for this. Angry
     that this is happening at all. Then:
                              VETROVA
                  Stay on the other side of the
                  plastic. Or I will have you removed
                  by security.
     Before Lyudmilla can respond, Vetrova WALKS AWAY. Then the
     orderlies exit the room and move past her as well.
     Her husband is now in there alone.
333 INT. ISOLATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 333
     We're on Vasily's side of the TRANSPARENT CURTAIN. Through
     the plastic, we see the DOOR open.
     Lyudmilla approaches. Then stops just on the other side of
     the plastic.

Lyusya?
VASILY
     A pause, then LYUDMILLA pushes through PLASTIC. On our side
     now. On Vasily's side. Stands right next to him.
                              LYUDMILLA
                  Yes, my love.
                              VASILY
                  Is it day?
                              LYUDMILLA
                  No, it's nighttime now.
                              VASILY
                        (confused)
                  I think I had a dream. But it's gone.
LYUDMILLA
                  We're going to have a baby.
     He doesn't respond. Perhaps too delirious to understand. But
     then... his HAND lifts slightly off the bed. Trembling. The
     SKIN sloughing off. He's reaching for her.
     He heard. He knows.
     And she gently reaches back to take his hand in hers.
334 INT. MOBILE OFFICE - CHERNOBYL COMMAND - NIGHT 334
     A plate with boiled chicken and beets. Untouched. A bottle
     of iodine pills. A full glass of water. A stack of maps.
     Books. Notepads. Blueprints.
     Legasov writes a LIST. Four pages in already. Hand cramping.
     He puts his pen down, takes his glasses off. Rubs his eyes.
     Picks up the glass of water. Then puts it down. His hand is
     TREMBLING. He stares at it, then:
     THE DOOR OPENS - and Shcherbina enters. Ebullient. A bottle
     of VODKA in his hand. He smiles at Legasov.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  The fire is out.
     He plunks the bottle down. Unscrews the cap, and tosses it.
     It lands in the corner with a plink.
Vasya.
      (beat)
36.

                              SHCHERBINA
                  It's out, Valera! And the miners are
                  making incredible progress. They say
                  the whole job will be finished in
                  four weeks. Four, can you believe it?
     He takes Legasov's WATER GLASS, empties it into the waste
     basket, and starts pouring vodka.
     But Legasov just stares blankly at his list.
     Shcherbina puts the vodka bottle down. Sighs. Just wants to
     find some small joy, even now. Even knowing what he knows.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  I know the job isn't over. But it's
                  the beginning of the end.
The beginning of the end? Legasov looks up. A strange look of pity on his face. And then... he slowly shakes his head.
No.
     The smile fades from Shcherbina's face, and: KNOCK KNOCK
     KNOCK on the door. Shcherbina crosses over and opens it. A
     soldier is standing there.
                              SOLDIER
                  I'm sorry to bother you, Deputy
Minister, but-- it's the miners. Shcherbina looks back at Legasov. What now?
335 EXT. REACTOR SITE - MOMENTS LATER 335
     Legasov and Shcherbina follow the soldier through the work
     site, under the glare of FLOODLIGHTS. They walk around a
     truck and stop dead, as they see:
     THE MINERS - working. Digging, emptying the carts, doing
     their job.
In the nude.
     Well, they have their shoes on. And their paper hats. But
     otherwise? Completely naked.
     Legasov and Shcherbina just stare dumbstruck. And then they
     sees GLUKHOV, as naked as the others.
     Legasov raises a hand to him. "May we have a word?"
37.
  
Glukhov walks over to them. Zero self-consciousness.
GLUKHOV
             What?
Legasov isn't quite sure what to say.
Oh.
            GLUKHOV
They won't give us fans, and it's too
hot for clothes. So we're digging the
old way. This is how our fathers
mined.
            GLUKHOV
We're still wearing the fucking hats.
What do you need?
            LEGASOV
You aren't as protected without--
            GLUKHOV
Are you telling me it will make a
difference?
     Legasov hesitates. Then remembers who he's dealing with.
     Shakes his head. No. It won't.
     Which is what Glukhov expected. He looks back at his men,
     then turns to Shcherbina.
                              GLUKHOV
                  When this is over-- will we be taken
care of?
     Legasov and Shcherbina say nothing. There's no point in
     lying to this man.
     Glukhov stares back at them in disgusted disappointment.
     Then without another word, he heads back to the tunnel.
     Naked. And resigned.
336 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 336
     A pen writes in Cyrillic in a notebook. Half a page of
     notes. The other page full. Six or seven pages behind that
     one. The pen underlines something. Then:
     KHOMYUK stops writing. Looks at Toptunov.
38.

                         KHOMYUK
             So the power level jumped from 200 to
             400 megawatts.
                         TOPTUNOV
             Yes. Very fast.
                         KHOMYUK
             Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button
             and shut the reactor down?
                         TOPTUNOV
             We did. I reported the increase to
             Akimov-- and he pressed the button.
Khomyuk puts her pen down.
                         KHOMYUK
             That's not possible, Leonid.
He turns to her. Grunting in pain from the effort.
                         TOPTUNOV
             He did. I saw him do it. I swear. And
             that's when it exploded.
She leans back. Utter disbelief. Silence, then:
What?
KHOMYUK
                         TOPTUNOV
             I wasn't supposed to be there.
                   (tears in his eyes)
             It wasn't supposed to be me.
Khomyuk can only stare in shock.
Vetrova enters with a nurse, who wheels a tray of medicine.
                         VETROVA
             I'm sorry, he needs rest now.
Khomyuk rises.
KHOMYUK
             Of course.
                   (mind spinning)
             Which room is Akimov?
27.
VETROVA
39.

337 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 27 - LATER 337
     CLOSE ON - Khomyuk's notebook. She finishes writing "pressed
     AZ-5, large jolt, then explosion" (Cyrillic).
     REVEAL - Khomyuk sitting in a different chair. Akimov's
     room. We never see Akimov. He remains off-camera. But we
     HEAR him. A terrible, rattling breath.
     Khomyuk's face tells us all we need to know about what
     Akimov must look like. There is terrible pity for him. And
     horror at what he is suffering.
                              KHOMYUK
                  Thank you, Comrade Akimov. You should
rest now.
     She gets up to leave, sick to her stomach and on the verge
     of tears. And we stay CLOSE on her as she HEARS him... his
     awful voice... pained and confused and heartbreaking.
                              AKIMOV (O.S.)
                  We did everything right... we did
                  everything right...
338 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 338
     Khomyuk emerges from Akimov's room. Cold sweats. She chokes
     back the nausea. Breathe... breathe... easy, easy...
     She begins walking down the hallway, trying to absorb what
     has become of these men. And what they've told her.
Breathe. Breathe. You're okay.
She turns a corner, then STOPS short. What is she seeing?
     REVEAL - she is right in front of the door into VASILY
     IGNATENKO'S room. She looks through the window.
     IN THE ROOM - Lyudmilla is sitting inside the protective
     plastic sheeting.
She is saying something to her husband that we cannot hear. She touches him with her left hand. But her right hand is held gently on her belly. She's smiling.
     Khomyuk stares in utter shock, then BARGES INTO:
40.
 
339 INT. ISOLATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 339
     She FLINGS the plastic slats aside and GRABS Lyudmilla by
     the wrist.
Get up!
KHOMYUK
Khomyuk PULLS Lyudmilla from the chair, and begins DRAGGING
her by the wrist toward the door.
Lyusya?
LET ME GO!
Lyusya?
VASILY
LYUDMILLA
VASILY
But Khomyuk keeps DRAGGING, pulling Lyudmilla out into the
hallway...
                         LYUDMILLA
                   (screaming)
             STOP IT! STOP IT!
VETROVA comes running over, drawn by the noise.
                         KHOMYUK
             You let her in that room? Inside the
             plastic? Touching him?
VETROVA LYUDMILLA What did I tell you? It's not true!
                         KHOMYUK
             Did you know she's pregnant?
Vetrova absorbs that in shock. Gapes at Lyudmilla.
                         VETROVA
             What have you done?
Lyudmilla, scared, starts to cry. Shaking her head. No.
Nothing. Nothing...
                         VETROVA
                   (again, terrified)
             What have you DONE?
Khomyuk lets go of Lyudmilla. Turns on Vetrova.
41.

            KHOMYUK
What kind of place is this? Where is
her protection? Do you have ANY IDEA
what you're dealing with?
            VETROVA
Of course I do. Please, I don't
want--
            KHOMYUK
No. People are going to hear about
this. Wait--
VETROVA
                              KHOMYUK
                  People are going to hear! You
                  understand? Everyone is going to
                  hear!
     The BLOND MAN steps in her path, stopping her short.
                              BLOND MAN
                  What is everyone going to hear?
     Khomyuk knows instantly what this is. And that she's made a
     terrible mistake. Only one way out of this.
                              KHOMYUK
                  I'm here on behalf of the official
                  Chernobyl commission. I have been
                  authorized by Valery Legasov to--
     She glances behind her, sensing ANOTHER MAN arriving from
     the other direction. Standing behind her now.
                              KHOMYUK
                  You can check this. My name is--
                              BLOND MAN
                  We know who you are.
                        (and again)
                  What is everyone going to hear?
340 EXT. KREMLIN - MORNING 340
     The sun rises over Moscow...
     TITLE:
MAY 7, 1986
42.
 
341 INT. KREMLIN HALLWAY - MORNING 341
     The same room we saw when Legasov first arrived at the
     Kremlin.
     And he's sitting in that little chair again. Waiting. This
     time, an empty chair next to him.
     A moment, then SHCHERBINA arrives. Sits down next to
     Legasov.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  You have your notes?
LEGASOV
                  Yes.
     Shcherbina seems preoccupied. Then:
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Khomyuk was arrested last night.
LEGASOV
Was it-- ?
                  Of course it was. I'm working on it.
                              LEGASOV
                  Boris, I can't--
                              SHCHERBINA
                  I'm working on it. What else do you
                  want from me?
                        (beat)
                  Fix your tie, for god's sake.
     Legasov has no choice but to accept this. And attempt to fix
     his crooked tie. Then:
     A door opens, and the AIDE emerges with a pleasant smile.
                              KREMLIN AIDE
                  They'll see you now.
What? Why?
I don't know.
SHCHERBINA
LEGASOV
SHCHERBINA

342 INT. KREMLIN CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING 342
     Gorbachev, the bureaucrats, and generals listen.
                              SHCHERBINA (O.S.)
                  ...and after thousands of sorties,
                  our brave helicopter crews
                  successfully extinguished the fire.
     Legasov is staring at one man across the table. At CHARKOV.
     The KGB minister.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  The miners are working heroically to
                  ensure that the fuel does not reach
                  the groundwater. Furthermore, there
                  is no longer a threat of additional
                  explosion. The Soviet People have
                  faced this challenge, and they have
                  risen to the task. They, and everyone
                  in this room, are to be commended.
     A palpable sense of relief in the room. Finally.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Lastly, Professor Legasov and I have
                  been vigilant to protect the security
                  interests of the State. Since the
                  unfortunate release of information
                  directly following the accident, we
                  believe there has been no further
                  lapse. Comrade Charkov, we hope we
                  have lived up to the higest standards
                  of the KGB.
     Charkov gives a non-committal smile.
CHARKOV
                  You have.
                        (glances at Legasov)
                  Of course you have.
     Legasov, caught staring, quickly averts his eyes.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Thank you. Professor Legasov will now
                  speak about the work that remains.
     Shcherbina sits, and Legasov rises. Reads from notes.
                              LEGASOV
                  Thank you. Deputy Minister Shcherbina
                  has given you the good news.
                              (MORE)
44.

                         LEGASOV (cont'd)
             And it is good. The immediate danger
             is over. But now, I am afraid, a long
             war must begin.
He glances up for a reaction. There is none. He continues.
                         LEGASOV
             There is an enormous amount of
             radioactive debris and contamination
             spread across a zone of approximately
             2,600 square kilometers. This entire
             region must be completely evacuated.
             Men will need to go to every town,
             every village, to ensure this.
Another look. Again, no one seems deeply concerned.
                         LEGASOV
             All animals still surviving within
             the zone-- domesticated or wild--
             must be presumed contaminated, and
             will have to be destroyed to prevent
             the spread of radiation and disease.
He turns a page. Unnerved by the silence.
                         LEGASOV
             In the immediate area around
             Chernobyl, every tree, every rock...
             the very ground itself has absorbed
             dangerous amounts of radionuclides,
             which will be carried by the wind or
             rain if left exposed. We will have to
             raze forests. And we will have to rip
             up the top layer of earth, and bury
             it under itself. Approximately 100
             square kilometers. Finally, we will
             need to construct a containment
             structure around the power plant
             itself, which of course is still
             extremely--
                   (beat)
             There will be deaths.
He's finished. Sits. A silence. Then a young general,
NIKOLAI TARAKANOV, 45, speaks up.
                         TARAKANOV
             What amount of time, what number of
             men do you require?
45.
 
                              SHCHERBINA
                  We expect this liquidation effort to
                  take three years, and approximately
                  750,000 men, including a number of
                  doctors and structural engineers.
                              GORBACHEV
                        (still stuck on--)
                  How many deaths?
                              LEGASOV
                  Thousands. Perhaps tens of thousands.
     Gorbachev absorbs that. The brutal weight of it. But there
     is no choice.
                              GORBACHEV
                  Begin at once.
343 INT. KREMLIN HALLWAY - LATER 343
     Meeting over. Legasov and Shcherbina emerge... and Legasov
     sees CHARKOV ahead, walking away.
     He can't help himself. Walks fast to chase Charkov down.
                              SHCHERBINA
                        (alarmed)
                  Valery...
     But all Shcherbina can do is follow Legasov, and:
                              LEGASOV
                  Comrade Charkov.
     Charkov stops and turns around. Ah.
                              CHARKOV
                  Yes, Professor?
                              LEGASOV
                  My associate was arrested last night.
Oh?
CHARKOV
            LEGASOV
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.
46.

                         CHARKOV
             I'm sorry. I don't know who you're
             talking about.
                         LEGASOV
                   (yes you do)
             She was arrested by the KGB.
Charkov says nothing. Just an "and?" face...
                         LEGASOV
             You are First Deputy Chairman of the
KGB.
             I am! That's why I don't have to
             bother with arresting people anymore.
                         LEGASOV
             But you are bothering to have your
             people follow me.
Okay. That's enough of that. Shcherbina takes Legasov's arm
to lead him away.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Professor, the Deputy Chairman is a
busy--
                         CHARKOV
             No, no, it's perfectly understandable.
                   (to Legasov, warmly)
             Comrade, I know you've heard the
             stories about us. When I hear them,
             even I am shocked. But we're not what
             people say. Yes, people are following
             you. People are following those
             people.
                   (points)
             And you see them?
Two non-descript men in suits at the end of the hallway.
                         CHARKOV
             They follow me. The KGB is a circle
             of accountability. Nothing more.
                         LEGASOV
                   (at a loss)
             You know the job we're doing. Do you
             really not trust us?
      CHARKOV
(friendly chuckle)
47.
    
                              CHARKOV
                  Of course I do! But you know the old
                  Russian proverb: "Trust, but verify."
                  And the Americans think Ronald Reagan
                  came up with that! Can you imagine?
                        (warmly)
                  It was very nice speaking with you.
     As he turns away:
                              LEGASOV
                  I need her.
     Charkov turns back. All warmth gone. Icewater stare.
                              CHARKOV
                  So you will be accountable for her?
     Legasov registers the implicit threat. Even so, he nods.
                              CHARKOV
                  Then it's done.
                              LEGASOV
                  Her name is--
                              CHARKOV
                  I know who she is.
                        (back to friendly)
                  Good day, Professor.
He walks off. Legasov feels Shcherbina's eyes on him. Knows he's about to get a lecture. But:
                              SHCHERBINA
                  No, that went surprisingly well. You
                  came off like a naive idiot.
                        (off Legasov's look)
                  Naive idiots aren't a threat.
344 EXT. PRISON - MOSCOW - NIGHT 344
     A squat, red building with a castle-like tower. Thunder
     rumbles in the distance. A storm is coming.
48.
  TITLE:
BUTYRSKAYA PRISON, MOSCOW

345 INT. HOLDING CELL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 345
     THE BLOND MAN walks down the dimly lit, narrow hallway. The
     ugly paint can't disguise the brutish, 19th century walls.
     All around us, the sounds of caged men. Junkies. Drunks.
     Lunatics. Enemies of the state. And occasionally, the scream
     of someone in pain.
     Legasov follows the Blond Man to:
     KHOMYUK'S JAIL CELL. She's sitting on the floor, back
     against the wall. And she is still, absurdly, in her
     radiation-protective outfit.
     She looks up at Legasov. A bit of relief. But mostly, numb.
     The Blond Man unlocks the barred door and slides it open.
                              BLOND MAN
                  I'll come back when the paperwork is
complete.
Legasov nods, and steps into the cell. The Blond Man closes the door, locks it, and exits. Legasov stands there.
                              LEGASOV
                  Are you all right?
                              KHOMYUK
                  They didn't hurt me.
                        (beat)
                  They let a pregnant woman into a room
                  with a-- it doesn't matter. They were
                  stupid. I was stupid.
     The misery of it all washes over her.
                              KHOMYUK
                  Dyatlov won't talk to me. Toptunov
                  and Akimov, yes, but...
                        (can still see him)
Akimov. Valery, his face is gone... LEGASOV
                  You want to stop.
                              KHOMYUK
                        (stares at him)
                  Is that a choice I even have?
     He slowly sits down next to her on the floor. She takes a
     long look at him. He's not well. And now she feels guilty.
49.

                         LEGASOV
             Do you think the fuel will actually
             melt through the concrete pad?
A strange non-sequitur.
What?
KHOMYUK
                         LEGASOV
             It's a matter of probability, of
             course. So... odds?
She doesn't understand this shift in tone, but--
                         KHOMYUK
             I don't know. A forty percent chance?
                         LEGASOV
             I've said fifty. Either way, the
             numbers mean the same thing. "Maybe."
             Maybe the core will melt down to the
             groundwater. Maybe the miners I've
             told to dig under the reactor will
             save millions of lives. Or maybe I'm
             killing them for nothing.
And now, shame. A confession.
                         LEGASOV
             I don't want to do this anymore. I
             want to stop.
                   (beat)
             But I can't. So tomorrow, I will wake
             up and make more decisions that will
             kill more people, because there is no
             alternative. And no, I don't think
             you have a choice any more than I do.
             I think, despite the lies, the
             stupidity--
                   (the jail)
             --even this... you are compelled. The
             problem has been assigned, and you
             will stop at nothing to find the
             answer. That is who you are.
And she knows he's right.
                         KHOMYUK
             A lunatic, then.
                         LEGASOV
             A scientist.
50.
 
     THE CELL DOOR - opens. The Blond Man stands waiting.
346 INT. BOOKING DESK - MOMENTS LATER 346
     Legasov waits while Khomyuk signs papers to receive her
     personal items. She hands the form across a desk to a prison
     attendant, who heads into a back room with the form, leaving
     them alone for a moment.
     There's something gnawing at her. Until she can't ignore it
     any longer... and she turns to Legasov.
                              KHOMYUK
                  Did you know they were running a
                  safety test?
     Legasov sighs. Yes. He heard. It's madness.
                              KHOMYUK
                  There's something else. Akimov says he
                  shut the reactor down, and Toptunov
                  confirms it. They pressed AZ-5.
                              LEGASOV
                  Apparently not soon enough.
                              KHOMYUK
                  No. They say Akimov pressed AZ-5, and
then the reactor exploded.
He stiffens. A jolt of fear in his stomach. She doesn't see.
                              KHOMYUK
                  If it had been just one of them, I
                  would have written it off as faulty
                  memory or even delusion... but they
                  both agreed. They were adamant.
     She turns to him. Legasov seems lost in thought.
KHOMYUK
                  Comrade?
     He snaps out of it. Turns to her.
                              LEGASOV
                  Do you think it's possible?
                              KHOMYUK
                  No. I think it makes no sense. I
                  think it's what I would say if I
                  wanted to cover my own mistakes.
51.

Understood.
But?
LEGASOV
                         KHOMYUK
             I believed them.
A beat, then he moves in close to her. Sotto voce, so no one
can overhear.
            LEGASOV
Then you should pursue it. We have to
pursue every possibility, no matter
how unlikely... and no matter what--
or who-- is to blame.
     The prison attendant returns with a bin holding Khomyuk's
     personal effects. As she gathers her items...
                              KHOMYUK
                  I'll go back to the hospital now and
                  reinterview Akimov and Toptunov... if
                  they're still awake.
                              LEGASOV
                  They're not.
She meets his eyes. Dead? Yes. They're gone. She's surprised by the depth of her own grief, and:
     SOUND FADES/MUSIC RISES
347 EXT. FINAL MONTAGE 347
     As the music plays, we dissolve from moment to moment,
     drifting back and forth like a ghost...
     OUTSIDE HOSPITAL NO. 6 - Lyudmilla exits the building. Numb.
     Suitcase in hand. The door closes behind her, but she
     doesn't look back. There's nothing left to see.
     ISOLATION ROOM - Vasily's bed is now empty. An orderly
     removes the blood-stained sheets.
     MOSCOW CITY STREET - Soldiers with CLIPBOARDS walk down the
     street, and begin heading into apartment buildings.
ACROSS THE STREET - more soldiers, heading into more buildings. Dozens of them. Old women watch. They've seen this before. Men will be taken now. Some won't come back.
52.
    
     HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK - SEVEN GURNEYS, each holding a
     PLASTIC-WRAPPED BODY. Two men in FULL HAZMAT SUITS lift one
     of the bodies and place it into a nondescript PLYWOOD
     COFFIN.
     MOSCOW PARKING LOT - a man at the front of a queue gets some
     papers stamped and handed back to him. He moves off to the
     left, and the next man steps up. This is PAVEL, 23, thin,
     pale and frightened. He shivers a bit in the cold drizzle
     that's begun to fall. He hands his documents to the unseen
     officer.
     STAMP. Papers are handed back, and Pavel is ushered off.
     We will see him again.
     HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK - the Hazmat men roughly hammer a lid
     onto the plywood coffin, then lift it and put it down into:
     A LARGER, ENTIRELY METAL COFFIN. Now they lift a heavy METAL
     LID, and place it on top.
     HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK - a Hazmat man is WELDING the metal
     coffin shut. A reflection of SHOWERING SPARKS in the clear
     plastic window covering his face.
     As the sparks RISE to fill our view, the music FADES...
     ...and is replaced by the TOLLING OF A BELL.
348 EXT. MITINSKOE CEMETERY - MOSCOW - LATE AFTERNOON 348
     A small gathering of mourners stand under a gray sky. Some
     are crying. Lyudmilla is not. She stares blankly ahead.
     In front of the mourners, a line of soldiers.
     We move through them to see: a large TRENCH has been dug in
     the State graveyard, about thirty feet away. There are
     already SIX METAL COFFINS in the trench.
     A TRUCK-MOUNTED CRANE moves into view, carrying the last of
     the WELDED-SHUT COFFINS. It lowers it down into the trench,
     where two SOLDIERS wait to hold it in place.
     The CRANE TRUCK pulls away, and the soldiers quickly
     scramble up and out of the trench. Frightened.
     Lyudmilla stares straight ahead. Then, in a quiet voice, to
     herself... almost a whisper...
53.
    
                         LYUDMILLA
             Open wide, O earth, and receive what
             was formed from you by the hand of God.
And now, a sound you do not hear at funerals. The deep THRUM of a heavy motor.
Lyudmilla watches, shaken, as:
A CEMENT MIXER backs into position at the edge of the
trench, and CONCRETE begins pouring out, FILLING THE TRENCH
with the METAL COFFINS.
Lyudmilla's eyes fill with tears, and she trembles from the
horror of it, but she does not look away.
CLOSE ON: a METAL COFFIN. The concrete rises around it, and
we wait and watch over the agonizing seconds...
...until the coffin disappears under the wet gray, and:
END OF EPISODE THREE
FADE TO BLACK
54.
