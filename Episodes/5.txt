501 EXT. PRIPYAT - DAY 501
     The iconic "PRIPYAT 1970" sign on the outskirts of town.
     Crisp and white. Colorful flowers planted at its base.
     MUSIC: score, recalling memories of glory, or perhaps a
     dream of a glory that never was.
502 EXT. PRIPYAT - VARIOUS - DAY 502
     Even a planned Soviet city can look beautiful on a day like
     this. Alive. Someone's dream of home...
     SITNIKOV (who went to the roof) takes a stroll with his
     wife. They hold hands. Their DAUGHTER, 4, toddles along in
     front of them with their DOG.
     OLD WOMEN sit together on a bench, gossiping and arguing as
     they do each day.
     YUVCHENKO (who held the reactor door open) - pulls his 2-
     year old SON along in a little WAGON.
     CITIZENS swim slowly across the community pool.
     LYUDMILLA is in a shop with OKSANA. She looks out through
     the shop window to the street, where she sees VASILY
     standing with MIKHAIL, who holds his baby.
Mikhail offers to let Vasily hold the baby, and he does.
Lyudmilla watches her husband cradling the infant. Vasily turns and sees her watching. He smiles at her. Pure love. And she smiles back. Her husband. Her life. One day it will be their baby. One day.
     A figure passes behind Vasily in the background.
     CLOSE ON - SHOES walking with purpose. We pull back to
     reveal - ANATOLY DYATLOV.
Lunch sack in his hand. Cigarette in his mouth. Walking as he does every single day. Walking to work. Ahead of him, up and off in the distance... the CHERNOBYL POWER PLANT.

503 INT. BRYUKHANOV'S OFFICE - DAY 503
TITLE:
                            APRIL 25, 1986
                               2:00 PM
     FOMIN sits patiently across from Bryukhanov's desk. DYATLOV
     sits in the other guest seat. Glances at Fomin. Casually
     disdainful of him. Silence.
     Then, finally:
                              FOMIN
                  I hear they might promote
                  Bryukhanov. This little problem we
                  have with the safety test? If it's
                  completed successfully... yes, I
                  think a promotion is very likely.
                  Who knows, maybe Moscow.
     Dyatlov's eyes narrow.
                              FOMIN
                  Naturally they'll put me in charge
once he's gone. And then I'll need someone to take my old job. I could pick Sitnikov...
     It takes a moment for Dyatlov to swallow his pride. Then:
                              DYATLOV
                  I would like to be considered.
                              FOMIN
                  I'll keep that in mind.
     The door opens, and BRYUKHANOV enters. Fomin rises, but
     Bryukhanov gives him an annoyed wave to sit the fuck down.
     Then he starts opening desk drawers. Looking for something.
                              FOMIN
                  Viktor Petrovich, preparations for
                  the test have gone smoothly. Comrade
                  Dyatlov has been working per my
                  instructions, and Reactor 4 output
                  has been reduced to 1600 megawatts.
                  With your approval, we're ready to
                  continue lowering power to--
                              BRYUKHANOV
                  We have to wait.
2.

Fomin and Dyatlov weren't expecting that. Not good.
                         FOMIN
             Is there-- ?
                         BRYUKHANOV
             You're going to ask me if there's a
             problem, Nikolai? You can't read a
             fucking face?
He's found a pack of cigarettes. Lights one. Tosses the
lighter down on his desk.
                         BRYUKHANOV
             Three years I've been trying to
             finish this test. Three years!
                   (beat)
             I just got a call from the grid
             controller in Kiev. He says we can't
             lower power any further. Not for
             another ten hours.
                         DYATLOV
             A grid controller? Where does he get
             off telling us--
BRYUKHANOV
It's not the grid controller's
             decision, Dyatlov-- it's the end of
             the month. All the productivity
             quotas? Everyone's working overtime,
             the factories need power, someone's
             pushing down from above. Not that
             we'll ever know who.
                   (smokes, then)
             So do we have to scrap it or what?
                         FOMIN
             No. I don't think so. If we need to
             wait ten hours, we wait.
                         BRYUKHANOV
             Running at half power? We're not
             going to have stability issues?
                         FOMIN
             No, I should think--
                         BRYUKHANOV
             I'm not asking you.
Fomin musters a smile to cover his bile. As you wish, sir.
3.
 
                              DYATLOV
                  It's safe. We'll maintain at 1600.
                  I'll go home, get some sleep, and
                  come back tonight. We'll proceed
                  then. I'll personally supervise the
                  test. And it will be completed.
     Bryukhanov considers that. Then a grunt of satisfaction.
                              BRYUKHANOV
                  Well I'm not waiting around. Call me
                  when it's done.
He gets up and walks out. Dyatlov follows. But Fomin lingers behind. Waits until they're gone. Then runs his fingers covetously along the edge of Bryukhanov's desk. The desk of a powerful man. A man in charge...
     SOUND: a loud ELECTRONIC BUZZER/BELL
504 EXT. CITY - MORNING 504
     A rambling, squat complex of white buildings dotted with
     barred windows. We hear the BUZZER BELL again. The sound of
     an institution on a rigid time schedule.
TITLE
                       LUKYANIVSKA PRISON, KIEV
                             MARCH, 1987
505 INT. LUKYANIVSKA PRISON CELL - SAME 505
     We PAN slowly across the dismal cell to find: FOMIN,
     dressed in the uniform of a Soviet prisoner, sitting on his
     cot. Crying. He barely looks like the same man.
Fomin removes his glasses with trembling hands to wipe his eyes, but the tears don't stop. They never stop. He stares at the glasses in his hand. Yes. Today.
506 INT. LUKYANIVSKA PRISON HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 506
     The cell block door opens, and three SOLDIERS enter and
     proceed down the hallway. The PRISON WARDEN stays behind.
     We remain with him as he calls out names.
                              WARDEN
                  Bryukhanov.
4.
 
A soldier stops at the first door. Unlocks it and slides
open. BRYUKHANOV, prison uniform, steps out. As the soldier
escorts him toward the cell block door...
Dyatlov.
WARDEN
A soldier opens a second door. DYATLOV steps out. He's
attempted to regrow his mustache, but it's barely there.
His posture is stooped. His skin is papery.
Fomin.
WARDEN
Down the hall, the third soldier opens a door. Then takes a
step back. Frozen.
                              WARDEN
     The soldier turns, then starts RUNNING back toward us.
507 INT. FOMIN'S CELL - CONTINUOUS 507
     We're ON THE FLOOR - looking across the room at the open
     door through a CRACKED LENS. Fomin's SHATTERED GLASSES.
     Shards are missing. BLOOD begins to SEEP FORWARD along the
     floor. It pools around the glasses, then continues ahead.
     More. And more.
     An ALARM sounds.
508 EXT. MOSCOW STREET - AFTERNOON 508
     A QUEUE of people waiting to purchase tobacco from a KIOSK.
     It's Legasov turn. He buys a pack of cigarettes, walks a
     few steps, takes out a cigarette, then almost runs into:
     A MAN IN A SUIT (KGB DRIVER). The man doesn't need to say a
     word. It's obvious what he is. He nods for Legasov to
     follow. Legasov dutifully does. No choice.
509 EXT. ALLEYWAY AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS 509
A BLACK ZIL LIMO is parked on the street. The KGB Driver opens the rear door, lets Legasov in, then CLOSES the door.
Fomin!
5.

510 INT. SEDAN - MOMENTS LATER 510
     CLOSE ON LEGASOV - sitting in the back seat, eyes forward.
                              CHARKOV (O.S.)
                  How do you feel?
     Legasov turns. Reveal: CHARKOV, the head of the KGB,
     sitting next to him in the back.
                              CHARKOV
                  You went to the doctor yesterday.
                  How is your health?
                              LEGASOV
                  You don't know?
     Charkov smiles. Very good. He opens his briefcase and
     removes a NEWSPAPER. Hands it to Legasov. It's in German.
     Below the fold on the front page, a PHOTOGRAPH of Legasov,
     from the IAEA conference. And a caption in German.
                              CHARKOV
                  From Vienna. Do you read German?
                        (no?)
                  It says, "At last, a Soviet
                  scientist who tells the truth."
                  Obviously I resent the insinuation,
                  but I think it's fair to say you
                  made an excellent impression at the
                  conference. It turns out you're
                  quite good at this.
     Legasov stares at the photo. Guilt rising inside him.
                              LEGASOV
                  At what? Lying?
                              CHARKOV
                  Statecraft, Legasov. Statecraft.
     Charkov takes the newspaper back from Legasov. Puts it back
     in his briefcase.
                              CHARKOV
                  The West is now satisfied that
                  Chernobyl was solely the result of
                  operator error. Which it essentially
                  was. We have you to thank for that.
                  And we intend to.
He hands Legasov another piece of paper. A list.
6.

                         LEGASOV
                   (reads)
             "Hero of the Soviet Union."
                         CHARKOV
             Our highest honor. They haven't even
             given it to me.
                         LEGASOV
             "Promotion to Director of the
             Kurchatov Institute."
Charkov gives that thin smile of his. He knows that's the
one Legasov wants.
                         LEGASOV
             I'm humbled.
                         CHARKOV
             I don't think there's anything
             humble about you, Valery
             Alexeyevich.
Charkov takes the paper back.
                         CHARKOV
             And these rewards are not yours yet.
             First, your testimony at the trial.
                         LEGASOV
             Comrade Charkov, I understand my
duty to the State-- but you gave us assurances. You said the reactors would be made safe. It's been months. There have been no changes made, no changes even discussed...
                         CHARKOV
                   (again)
             First, the trial. Once it's over, we
             will have our villains, we will have
             our hero... we will have our truth.
                   (uninterested)
             After that, we can deal with the
             reactors.
Charkov dismisses him with a wave of the hand. Nothing left to say. Legasov opens the door to exit, and:
                         CHARKOV
             Oh, I should mention-- the trial is
             going to be somewhat delayed.
7.
  
Why?
LEGASOV
                              CHARKOV
                  Talk to Shcherbina.
                              LEGASOV
                        (confused)
                  Shcherbina's in Kiev. I haven't
                  heard from him in--
                              CHARKOV
                  He returned to Moscow an hour ago.
     Charkov gives Legasov that smile again.
                              CHARKOV
                  Or so I've been told.
     The KGB DRIVER opens the door fully to let Legasov out.
     Legasov EXITS and watches as the ZIL drives away.
511 INT. LIVING ROOM - SHCHERBINA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 511
     SHCHERBINA stands by the window, looking out. His hair is a
     touch thinner. A subtle aging to his skin.
                              LEGASOV (O.S.)
                  When?
     Shcherbina turns to LEGASOV - who sits in a chair. Ashen.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Early this morning. He broke his
                  glasses and used the shards--
                        (his wrist)
                  They got to him in time. He's in the
                  hospital, under observation.
                              LEGASOV
                  Guilty conscience?
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Or he was making a statement.
     SHCHERBINA'S DAUGHTER, 30, enters the room with a tea
     service. Her son, 4, runs in and HUGS Shcherbina on the
     leg. Shcherbina lights up. Lifts the boy with some effort.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Did you bring grandpapa tea? Is that
                  what you did? You brought him tea?
8.

He kisses his grandson on the forehead, then puts him back
down. Again, an effort. It was easy a year ago.
His daughter takes her son by the hand and exits.
Shcherbina's smile fades. Then:
                         SHCHERBINA
             There's something else. The trial
             won't be in Kiev. They've changed
             the venue.
                         LEGASOV
             Here, then?
                         SHCHERBINA
             No. Chernobyl. To be clear, not the
             power plant. The town.
LEGASOV
The evacuated town thirty kilometers
             away from the reactor?
                         SHCHERBINA
             Twenty, actually.
                         LEGASOV
             For god's sake, why?
                         SHCHERBINA
             I presume they want to demonstrate
             that the exclusion zone is now safe
             enough to hold a trial.
                         LEGASOV
             Well it isn't.
                         SHCHERBINA
             You don't look good.
                         LEGASOV
             I'm not sleeping.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Is that all?
Legasov doesn't answer. He just removes his glasses, weary.
Turns them around in his hand. Thinking about Fomin again.
Mystified by the man's actions.
                         LEGASOV
             His glasses...

9.

512 INT. KHOMYUK'S LABORATORY - DAY 512 EXTREME CLOSE ON: the letters A3-5 (AZ-5 in Cyrillic).
     Khomyuk stares at the Volkov article. Exhausted from
     torturing herself. Wishing she'd never read it. Wishing she
     didn't know.
     Enough. She has work to do. She pushes the Volkov article
     aside. Picks up a stack of requisition forms. Paperwork.
     Endless paperwork. Scans the first form, then initials.
     Next form. Initials. Next form...
     She's lost focus again. This time, it's a FILE BOX that has
     drawn her attention.
     She hesitates, then crosses to the box, and lifts the lid.
     Inside, NOTEBOOKS. About a dozen. She takes one out. Opens
     it. Pages and pages... all filled with her handwriting.
     She runs her fingers over the neat Cyrillic penmanship.
                              MEMORY (O.S.)
                  My name is Leonid Fedorovych
                  Toptunov. I am the Senior Reactor
                  Control Chief...
     The voices are raspy. Strained. Turn a page...
                              MEMORY (O.S.)
                  Vasily Ivanovich Ignatenko. 6th
                  Paramilitary Fire/Rescue Unit...
     Turn a page... the weakened voices begin to blend...
                              MEMORY (O.S.)
                  Svetlana Zinchenko, physician...
                  Anatoly Andreyevich Sitnikov, deputy
                  chief engineer...
                  Aleksander Genadyevich Kudryavtsev,
                  trainee...
     She closes her eyes. She was with them all. Listened to
     them all. Knew them all.

                  Electrical engineer...

She opens her eyes. Looks down at the page.

     She looks up from the notebook. An idea. And now more than
     an idea. A decision.
     She snaps the book shut, and:
CUT TO:
513 INT. LEGASOV'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY 513
     Legasov stares at: TECHNICAL SCHEMATICS spread out on his
     table like a visual representation of a CONTROL PANEL.
He smokes. Studies them silently. The table clock tick tick ticks. The cat pads softly over stacks of BOOKS.
     Legasov notices: two strands of HAIR on the schematics.
     Long. Like they fell from the root.
     He reaches up to his head and runs his fingers through his
     hair. A few more STRANDS pull away without effort.
     He studies the hair in his hand, shakes it off and wipes
     the schematics clean. This isn't the first time.
     KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
     Legasov snaps out of it. Startled. Heads to the door.
514 INT. LEGASOV'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 514
     Khomyuk sits across from Legasov, the file box on her lap.
     Neither of them sure who's supposed to talk first. Then:
                              LEGASOV
                  Did you take a train?
     Oh for god's--
                              KHOMYUK
                  Yes, I took a train, now let's talk
                  about Vienna.
                        (as he reacts)
                  I haven't come to scold you. I know
                  how the world works. I'm a realist,
                  no matter what Shcherbina thinks.
11.

                         LEGASOV
             Then why are you here?
                         KHOMYUK
             Because I'm brutally stubborn. Which
             you were hoping for.
Right. So. As if to convince her...
                         LEGASOV
             Charkov is saying they're going to
             fix the reactors after the trial.
                         KHOMYUK
             Do you believe him?
A pause. No. Of course not. But Khomyuk leans in.
                         KHOMYUK
             The State will never willingly fix
             the reactors, because acknowledging
             the problem means admitting they
             lied. They will have to be forced.
Forced? What is she on about?
                         KHOMYUK
             At the trial, you're going to tell
             the truth. You're going to convince
             a jury.
Legasov stares at her as if she's lost her mind.
LEGASOV
It's a show trial. The "jury" has
             already been given their verdict...
                         KHOMYUK
             I'm not talking about them. The
             Central Committee has invited
             members of the scientific community
             to observe the trial. Our
             colleagues. From Kurchatov, from
             Sredmash, from Minenergo...
And now Legasov sees where she's going.
                         KHOMYUK
             They will be sitting in the crowd,
listening to every word you say. A jury only we know is there.
(MORE)
12.

                         KHOMYUK (cont'd)
             And when your testimony arrives at
the moment of the explosion... that is when our jury will finally hear the truth.
                         LEGASOV
             And do what with it?
                         KHOMYUK
             Insist on reforms. Not just to the
             RBMK, but the entire industry.
LEGASOV KHOMYUK
No, no, no... no. They need us to function. If
                               we refuse to work unless--
                         LEGASOV
             Do you know what happened to Volkov?
The man who wrote the report you found? They just removed him from his position at the Institute. Sacked for the crime of knowing. And you think these scientists, handpicked to witness a show trial, will somehow be stirred to action? By me? Because of some heroic stand I take in defiance of the State?
13.
   Yes.
Why?
KHOMYUK
LEGASOV
KHOMYUK
             Because you're Legasov. And you mean
             something. I'd like to think if I
             spoke out, it would be enough.
                   (beat)
             But as I said, I know how the world
             works.
                         LEGASOV
             They will shoot me, Khomyuk.
Khomyuk lifts the lid off the box. Pulls out her notebooks,
and begins stacking them in a PILE on Legasov's table.
                         KHOMYUK
             You told me to find out what
             happened. I talked to dozens of
             people. Every word they said, I
             wrote down. All in these books.
 
     The stack is about twelve books high. She pulls out two
     more notebooks, and places them next to the larger stack.
                              KHOMYUK
                        (the two books)
                  These are the ones who are still
                  alive.
                        (the twelve books)
                  These are the ones who are dead.
                  They died rescuing each other.
                  Putting out fires. Tending to the
                  wounded. They didn't hesitate. They
                  didn't waver. They simply did what
                  had to be done.
                              LEGASOV
                  So have I. I went willingly to an
                  open reactor. I've also given my
                  life. Is that not enough?
                              KHOMYUK
                  I'm sorry. But it is not.
     RISING SOUND: a distant, whistling wind

     CLOSE ON: a RUSTING CAR.
     We SLOWLY RISE to reveal: more cars. And buses. Trucks.
     Fire engines. Bulldozers. Helicopters. Acres and acres of
     DEAD, CONTAMINATED VEHICLES, stacked in rows. A CEMETERY.
A BARBED WIRE FENCE dotted with garish red and orange RADIATION SIGNS surrounds the vehicle graveyard. We move to FIND: a convoy of cars moving down a distant ROAD in the background.

520 INT. TRIAL ROOM - DAY 520
CLOSE ON: ANDREI STEPASHIN, 50, the STATE PROSECUTOR, suit and tie, reading rapidly and monotonically from a typed speech.
                              STEPASHIN
                  The Central Committee of the
                  Communist Party of the Soviet Union
                  and the Presidium of the Supreme
                  Soviet of the U.S.S.R. has
                  determined that justice be carried
                  out on behalf of the People in
                  accordance with the general goal of
                  our Party as determined by its 20th,
                  21st and 22d Congresses, which is a
                  Leninist goal. It was, is and will
                  be the only immutable goal in the
                  Soviet state.
     THE TRIAL ROOM - a small, repurposed auditorium setting.
     Against the NORTH WALL of the room, a RED DAIS on the low
     stage. Three middle-aged men in suits. Ceremonial chairs.
     The man in the center is JUDGE MILAN KADNIKOV, 55. Behind
     them, an orange-yellow curtain.
     Against the WEST WALL, a pale blue curtain. In front of it,
     a DEFENDANT BOX. Bryukhanov, Dyatlov and Fomin sit in the
     box. Suit jackets. Two RED ARMY SOLDIERS stand guard on
     either side.
15.
  
THE REST OF THE ROOM - auditorium seats. Civilians, Soviet officials, military. Near Stepashin, an EXPERT WITNESS TABLE. Legasov, Khomyuk and Shcherbina.
As Stepashin DRONES, we're CLOSE ON LEGASOV. The air is
STIFLING. Hard to breathe. The HOT LIGHTS and mosquito-like
electric HUM of bulky Soviet press video cameras.
Legasov wipes sweat from his brow. A single, useless FAN in the corner of the room goes ting ting ting ting ting...
                         STEPASHIN
             The path of Leninist principles shall
             be consistently and undeviatingly
             followed as it expresses the vital
             interests of the Soviet People, its
             hopes and aspirations as we guide the
             life of the Party and State. This
             session of court is now open, Comrade
             Judge Milan Kadnikov presiding.
             Indictments--
As Stepashin recites the charges, Khomyuk leans in to whisper to Legasov. He puts a hand up. Yes. He sees them.
Legasov glances over his shoulder, and we see: SIX PEOPLE, four men, two women, seated together in the audience. Men and women he knows. Scientists. The invisible jury...
                         STEPASHIN
             Viktor Bryukhanov, Anatoly Dyatlov
             and Nikolai Fomin are accused of
             violating Article 220 Section 2 of
             the Criminal Code of the Soviet Union
             resulting in a nuclear disaster on
             April 26, 1986. The State calls
             witnesses Comrade Khomyuk of the
             Byelorusian Nuclear Institute,
             Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
             Institute of Atomic Energy, and--
                   (show of deference)
             --Comrade Boris Evdokimovich
             Shcherbina, Deputy Chairman of the
             Council of Ministers and head of the
             Bureau for Fuel and Energy.
Stepashin sits down. There's a pause. Shcherbina leans forward to look at Stepashin. Am I on?
Stepashin gives him a gentle nod, like a director responsible for cueing his actors. Yes. You're on.
16.
     
521 INT. TRIAL ROOM - LATER 521
     CLOSE ON: A MODEL of REACTOR BUILDING #4, as it existed
     before the explosion, is slowly WHEELED IN on a cart.
                              SHCHERBINA (O.S.)
                  It began with-- of all things-- a
safety test.
     Shcherbina stands before the tribunal. Legasov and Khomyuk
     sit at the table behind him.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  But why was there a need for a
                  safety test at all?
     THE DEFENDANTS - listen silently. Fomin seems lost. In a
     fog. Dyatlov remains stern. Bryukhanov hangs his head
     slightly. He knows what's coming.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Reactor #4 was not new when this
                  accident occurred. In fact, the
                  reactor went into operation on
                  December 20th, 1983. Eleven days
                  later, on the last day of year,
                  Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
                  signed this document--
     He hands the document to the judges.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  --certifying that construction of
                  the reactor had been completed. As a
                  result of finishing this work before
                  the end of the year, Comrade
                  Bryukhanov was awarded Hero of
                  Socialist Labour.
     Shcherbina turns his gaze on the defendants.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Comrade Fomin was awarded for
                  Valorous Labour. Comrade Dyatlov was
                  given an Order of the Red Banner.
                        (beat)
                  But the work was not finished. And
                  that certificate... was a lie. In
                  order to sign that document, all
                  safety tests had to have been
                  successfully completed. And yet, one
                  remained.
17.
   
As he talks, he points out various parts of the model.
                         SHCHERBINA
             A nuclear reactor generates heat in
the core-- here. A series of pumps here send a constant flow of cooling water through the core. The core's heat turns the water to steam, the steam spins a turbine here, and the result is electricity.
(beat)
But what if a power plant has no power? What if the power feeding the plant itself is disrupted? A blackout, equipment failure... an attack by a foreign enemy?
Shcherbina points to the pumps.
                         SHCHERBINA
             If there is no power, the pumps
cannot move water through the core. Without water, the core overheats, and the fuel melts down. In short-- a nuclear disaster. The solution? Three diesel fuel backup generators here. So. Problem solved?
                   (beat)
             No. Bryukhanov knew the problem was
             not solved at all. The backup
             generators took approximately one
             minute to reach the speed required
             to power the pumps and prevent a
             meltdown. By that point, it would be
             too late. And so-- we arrive at the
             safety test.
Khomyuk leans back. Surprised. Impressed with his
                         SHCHERBINA
             The theory was this: if the facility
             lost power, the turbine-- which had
             been spinning-- would take some time
             to slow down and stop. What if you
             could take the electricity it was
             still generating, and transfer it to
             the pumps? What if the dying turbine
             could keep the pumps working long
             enough to bridge the sixty-second
             gap until the generators came on?
He looks up at the judges. Suddenly insecure.

 command.

                              SHCHERBINA
                  Please, if you have any questions...
                              JUDGE KADNIKOV
                  No. Continue.
     Shcherbina nods. Good. Proud of himself.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  To test this theory, the reactor is
                  placed in a reduced power mode-- 700
                  megawatts-- to simulate a blackout
                  condition. Then-- the turbines are
                  shut off, and as they slowly spin
                  down, their electrical output is
                  measured to see if it is sufficient
                  to power the pumps. The science is
                  strong-- but a test is only as good
                  as the men carrying it out. The
                  first time they tried, they failed.
                  The second time they tried, they
                  failed. The third time they tried,
                  they failed.
                        (beat)
                  The fourth time they tried-- was on
                  April 26th, 1986.
     The room is silent. Shcherbina knows he's done well. He
     enjoys the moment-- then crosses back to the table.

                  Comrade Khomyuk.
522 INT. TRIAL ROOM - LATER 522
     New soldiers enter to relieve the guards by the defendants.
                              KHOMYUK (O.S.)
                  To understand what happened that
                  night, we have to look back ten
                  hours earlier.
KHOMYUK - stands in the center of the room, delivering her testimony. She glances at: THE SIX SCIENTISTS. The "jury." She wishes she could say the truth to them herself, right here and now... but has to be Legasov. So she continues...
                              KHOMYUK
                  April 25th. The day the test was
meant to take place. (MORE)
19.
 
            KHOMYUK (cont'd)
By two in the afternoon, the reactor
has been lowered by half from its
normal output of 3200 megawatts to
1600 megawatts, and is now ready to
be reduced to the final level for
the test. 700 megawatts. But before
they can proceed, there is a phone
call.
      (beat)
Power grid officials in Kiev say
they cannot afford a further
reduction in electricity until after
midnight. They're asking for a ten
hour delay. This was the first
critical moment-- the first link in
the chain of disaster. Competent
management would have insisted on
canceling the test. These three men
allowed it to proceed.
      (beat)
Why was this ten hour delay so
dangerous? It created two problems.
One is scientific in nature. The
other... is very human. That's the
one we'll consider first.
      (beat)
At midnight--

                  --there is a shift change.
     The air brakes hiss. A line of men exit the bus, passing a
     line of men waiting to get on.
     TOPTUNOV steps out. He heads toward: THE POWER PLANT -
     peaceful in the background.

     Gorbanchenko. Stolyarchuk. Toptunov. And now... a man whose
     name we've heard, but not yet seen.
DISSOLVE TO:

                              PEREVOZCHENKO
                  Khodemchuk...!
     KHODEMCHUK, slender, 35, leans out from behind his locker.
                              PEREVOZCHENKO
                  I brought a picture of the
motorcycle.
                              KHODEMCHUK
                  I already told you no.
                              PEREVOZCHENKO
                  You said you wanted to buy...
                              KHODEMCHUK
                  I was drunk.
                              PEREVOZCHENKO
                  So, you'll be drunk again-- and then
                  you'll have a motorcycle!
     The men laugh.
525 OMITTED 525 526 INT. CLEAN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 526
     White uniforms-- pants, jackets, boots, hats,
     underclothes-- are stacked on tables.
     Nude men filter in from the locker room and grab uniforms.
     Others (Perevozchenko, Toptunov, Brazhnik, Yuvchenko) are
     already in the process of getting dressed.
     The room is remarkably sterile, except for the fact that
     most of the men are SMOKING.
     As he suits up, Perevozchenko sees Khodemchuk enter.
                              PEREVOZCHENKO
                  Khodemchuk...
                              KHODEMCHUK
                  Forget it. Find another fool.
     Perevozchenko sighs. Then turns to:
Toptunov--
PEREVOZCHENKO
21.

                              BRAZHNIK
                  Toptunov? Look at him. He's too
                  young to drive. He's got more hair
                  on his face than on his balls.
     The men laugh. Yuvchenko points at Toptunov's mustache.
                              YUVCHENKO
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?
More laughter. Toptunov shakes his head. Come on guys...
     As Toptunov puts on his boots, Proskuryakov (the trainee),
     already in uniform, pops his head into the room.
                              PROSKURYAKOV
                  Leonid Fedorovych... Akimov says to
                  come to the control room as soon as
                  you're ready.
                              TOPTUNOV
                  He's already here?
                              PROSKURYAKOV
                  He came in a little early. Something
                  about a test.
     A test? What test?
527 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - MOMENTS LATER 527
     Toptunov enters with the trainee. Akimov is at the main
     control panel, staring at an open BINDER. Flipping pages.
     Stolyarchuk and Kirschenbaum are at their panels. The other
     trainee, Kudryavtsev, stands in the back, watching.
Sasha?
TOPTUNOV
Akimov turns, and Toptunov sees the worry on his face.
Akimov waves him over. Keeps his voice low.
                         AKIMOV
             You know the test they were supposed
to run?
No, he doesn't. Then he glances at: THE OUTPUT DISPLAY - a large box with RED LED DIGITS. It reads 1600. Why so low?
22.

                         AKIMOV
             The turbine rundown. The one they
             tried last year? They couldn't do it
             on the day shift so... they've given
             it to us.
TOPTUNOV
To us? We don't even know what it--
Akimov puts a hand up. Sshhh. People are always listening.
                         TOPTUNOV
                   (voice low)
             We don't know what it is.
                         AKIMOV
             It's fine. We take it down to 700,
             hold it there, and the rest is
             Stolyarchuk and Kirschenbaum. But--
                   (beat)
             Dyatlov is going to be supervising.
Now Toptunov knows why Akimov is worried. And with cause.
                         TOPTUNOV
             I have to do something I've never
done before with Dyatlov over my shoulder?
                         AKIMOV
             Don't worry. We'll do it together.
             I'm looking at the instructions now.
Toptunov glances down at the manual. Nods. All right, so far, so good. He understands. Then he turns a page. There is a NUMBERED LIST of instructions. There are black LINES drawn through several of the items.
                         TOPTUNOV
             Are we supposed to do those or not?
Impossible to say. Akimov picks up a PHONE. Dials. Then:
                         AKIMOV
             Yes, this is Akimov in 4. We have
             the manual for the rundown test, you
             did this before on--
                   (listens)
             Well in the program there are
             instructions of what to do, and then
             a lot of things are crossed out.
             What should I-- ?
(MORE)
23.

                         AKIMOV (cont'd)
                   (listens)
             Are you sure? Right. Thank you.
He hangs up. Turns to Toptunov.
                         AKIMOV
             He says to follow the crossed out
             instructions.
                         TOPTUNOV
             Then why were they crossed out?
The door flings open. DYATLOV strides in. Dressed in the
same white uniform. No warning, no greeting. All business.
                         DYATLOV
             We've been cleared to run the test.
                   (checks the power)
             1600. Good. Now-- is it too much to
             ask that you all know what you're
             doing?
                         TOPTUNOV
             Well-- we...
                         AKIMOV
                   (cuts off Toptunov)
             Yes. Absolutely.
                         DYATLOV
             Stolyarchuk?
Yes.
STOLYARCHUK
                         DYATLOV
             Kirschenbaum?
                         KIRSCHENBAUM
             I haven't reviewed-- we only just
             found out we--
Dyatlov grabs a BINDER from the desk in the center of the
room, and flings it at Kirschenbaum.
                         DYATLOV
             There. Review it. Or just do what I
             tell you. I think even you, as
             stupid as you are, can manage that.
Dyatlov deliberately lights a cigarette. Checks his watch.
24.

                              DYATLOV
                  Well? Let's go.
     ON KIRSCHENBAUM - flipping through the binder. He's
     muttering to Stolyarchuk.
                              KIRSCHENBAUM
                  I'm supposed to switch the turbine
off while the reactor's still running? That's not a good--
     But he's just loud enough for Dyatlov to hear.
                              DYATLOV
                  SHUT THE FUCK UP and do your job.
     Kirschenbaum puts his hand up. Sorry... sorry...
                              DYATLOV
                  Toptunov. Reduce power to 700.
     ON TOPTUNOV and AKIMOV, side by side over the controls.
                              TOPTUNOV
                        (a bare whisper)
                  I've never done this with the power
                  so low.
                              AKIMOV
                        (whispers back)
                  It's okay. I'm with you.
     ON THE PANEL - Toptunov's finger begins pushing down on
     buttons. One after another.
                              TOPTUNOV
                  Reducing power to 700...
                              KHOMYUK (V.O.)
                  I want you to think of Yuri Gagarin.
528  INT. TRIAL ROOM - DAY
     Khomyuk addresses the room.
                              KHOMYUK
                  I want you to imagine he had been
                  told nothing of his mission into
                  space until the moment he was on the
                  launch pad.

                              KHOMYUK (cont'd)
                  I want you to imagine all he had was
                  a list of instructions he'd never
                  seen before, with some of them
                  crossed out.
     The room is silent.
                              KHOMYUK
                  That is exactly what was happening
                  in the control room of Reactor 4.
     She walks toward the defendants.
                              KHOMYUK
                  The night shift had not been trained
                  to perform the experiment. They
                  hadn't even been warned it was
                  happening. Leonid Toptunov-- the
                  operator responsible for controlling
                  and stabilizing the reactor that
                  night-- was all of 25-years old. And
                  his total experience on the job?
                        (beat)
                  Four months.
                        (beat)
                  This was the human problem created
                  by the delay. But inside the reactor
                  core-- in the space between atoms
                  themselves-- something far more
                  dangerous was forming. A poison.
                        (beat)
                  The time is 28 past midnight.
     She crosses back to table and takes her seat next to
     Legasov. Her part is over. It's up to him now.
Legasov takes a breath. Sweaty palms. tick tick tick of the fan. In the back, someone coughs.
                              STEPASHIN
                        (glaring)
                  Comrade Legasov.
     He nods. Yes. It's time. He rises, and:
529 INT. TRIAL ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 529
     CLOSE ON - the WOBBLING WHEEL of a small metal pushcart.
     A SOLDIER guides the cart into place in front of a large
     white MAGNET BOARD on an easel, which another soldier
     adjusts into place.
26.
    
A LINE runs down the middle of the board, dividing it in two. On the cart: PLACARDS, some BLUE, some RED. They each have something written on them in Cyrillic.
It's all rather functional.
The guards step away, and Legasov takes his place by the cart and easel. Looks out at the room. The lights. The camera whine. Someone sniffles. His throat is closing.
He takes a breath. Focuses. And again, he sees them, sitting
in their row, listening attentively: THE SIX SCIENTISTS.
                         LEGASOV
             I am pleased to see some of my
             colleagues are here-- from the
             Kurchatov Institute and Minenergo.
Khomyuk straightens up. He's acknowledged them. He's
thinking about them. There's a chance...
                         LEGASOV
             But you don't need to be a nuclear
             scientist to understand what happened
             at Chernobyl. You only need to know
             this: there are essentially two things
             that happen inside a nuclear reactor.
He holds up a RED placard, and a BLUE placard.
                         LEGASOV
             The "reactivity"-- which generates
             the power-- goes up, or it goes down.
             That's it. And all the operators do
             is maintain the balance.
He fixes the RED placard - "Nuclear Fission" (R1) to the top of the RIGHT COLUMN of the board. The words on the placard are in Cyrillic. Doesn't matter.
All that matters is the BRIGHT RED COLOR.
                         LEGASOV
             Uranium fuel. As uranium atoms split
             apart and collide, reactivity goes
             up. But if you don't balance the
             reactivity, it never stops rising.
Next, Legasov puts the BLUE PLACARD - "Control Rods" (B1), in the LEFT COLUMN. Balancing it out. Blue/cool, red/hot.
27.
     
                         LEGASOV
             Boron control rods. They reduce
reactivity, like brakes on a car.
He places another BLUE PLACARD - "Water" (B2) on the left.
                         LEGASOV
             But there's a third factor to
consider. Water. Cool water takes heat out of the system. But as it does, it turns to steam, or what we call a void.
He places two RED PLACARDS - "Positive Void Coefficient" (R2) and another "Nuclear Fission" (R3) - on the right side.
                         LEGASOV
             In an RBMK reactor of the type used
at Chernobyl, there is something called a "positive void coefficient." What does that mean? It means the more steam, the higher the reactivity, which means more heat, which means more steam-- it would appear we have a vicious cycle on our hands. And we would, if not for this.
Legasov picks up a BLUE PLACARD - "Negative Temperature Coefficient" (B3) and places it on the left column.
                         LEGASOV
             Negative temperature coefficient.
When nuclear fuel gets hotter, it gets less reactive. So--
He stares at the board. Even after all this time, he still
can't help but marvel at the science. He moves his hands
between the columns of RED and BLUE...
                         LEGASOV
             --fuel increases reactivity. Control
             rods and water reduce it. Steam
             increases it, and the rise in
             temperature reduces it. This is the
             invisible dance that powers entire
             cities without smoke or flame. And
             it is beautiful...
He turns back to the room.
28.
   
LEGASOV When things are normal.
Legasov lifts up a BLUE PLACARD. "Xenon Poisoning" (B4).
                              LEGASOV
                  As uranium splits apart to release
                  energy, it breaks down into a new
                  element. Xenon. Xenon reduces
                  reactivity. This is the poison
                  Comrade Khomyuk mentioned. When the
                  core is running at full power, it
                  burns the xenon away before it can
                  cause a problem. But because of the
                  delay, Chernobyl Reactor 4 was held
                  at half power for ten hours. The
                  xenon did not burn away. It built up,
                  poisoning the core.
He places "Xenon Poisoning" (B4) on the board. LEGASOV
                  We're starting to lose balance.
     The BLUE column is longer than the RED. The words don't
     matter. The colors tell the tale.
LEGASOV
At 28 past midnight, the reactor is
now primed to slow down. And yet, in less than an hour, it will explode.
                        (beat)
                  If you can't understand how a
                  stalled reactor could lead to an
                  explosion, I do not blame you. After
                  all, you don't work in the control
                  room of a nuclear power plant.
     He turns to the defendants.
                              LEGASOV
                  But as it turned out, the men who
did... did not understand it either. 530 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - NIGHT
THE LED DISPLAY: 1600. And then... it begins lowering. 1590. 1570. 1510...
     Akimov and Toptunov stare up from the panel-- still
     shoulder to shoulder, hands on buttons.
530
29.
         
THE DISPLAY - 1450... 1395... AKIMOV
                  Easy now. Slow it down.
     Toptunov nods. Wipes sweat from his head. Makes an
     adjustment.
                              AKIMOV
                  Good. Like that.
     In the B.G. - Dyatlov PACES. Shaking his head.
                              DYATLOV
                  You should have been finished by
now.
                              AKIMOV
                  We're following protocol for
                  reduction rate.
                              DYATLOV
                  You're procrastinating. There are
                  ten other men in this plant who
                  would have done it already.
     Toptunov glances at Akimov, but Akimov doesn't look back.
     Just keeps his eyes on the panel.
                              AKIMOV
                        (to Toptunov)
                  Keep working. You're doing fine.
     Dyatlov takes a cigarette from his pack. Tosses the pack on
     to the table. Annoyed.
                              DYATLOV
                  Kirschenbaum. Come get me when these
                  old women are ready.
                              KIRSCHENBAUM
                  Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.
     Dyatlov EXITS. Slams the door behind him.
531 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM 4 - CONTINUOUS 531
     Dyatlov steps into the corridor. Lights his cigarette.
     Checks his watch. Then looks through the window by the
     landing, which faces out toward:
     THE LIGHTS OF PRIPYAT - just a few on at this late hour.
30.

532 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - MINUTES LATER 532
     Kirschenbaum and Stolyarchuk wait quietly. Stolyarchuk
     checks a meter... makes an adjustment to his panel.
Toptunov and Akimov continue to work their panel. THE DISPLAY: 775... 765... 755...
                              AKIMOV
                  Okay. Very slow now. Let's coast
down to 700.
THE DISPLAY: 745... 725... 715...
                              AKIMOV
                  Whoa whoa whoa... slow!
                              TOPTUNOV
                        (confused)
I didn't move any rods there... THE DISPLAY: 700... 680... 640... 590...
     Akimov looks at the display. Utterly bewildered.
                              AKIMOV
What is this? Toptunov puts his hands up.
                              TOPTUNOV
                  I'm not even touching it.
THE DISPLAY: 570... 550... 540...
533 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM 4 - CONTINUOUS 533
As Dyatlov finishes his cigarette, Akimov emerges from the control room. Dyatlov turns to him and can immediately see from Akimov's face that something's gone wrong. Again.
     All he wanted was one fucking moment of quiet, and now...?
534 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - CONTINUOUS 534
     Dyatlov storms in, followed by Akimov. And the first thing
     Dyatlov sees is:
THE DISPLAY: 520... 515... 510...
31.
 
                         AKIMOV
             We did everything right. I think
             maybe the core is poisoned...
                         DYATLOV
             If you thought the core was poisoned
             then you DIDN'T do everything right,
             because you're CHOKING MY REACTOR!
             Get it back up!
Akimov knows there's no sense in debating. Just:
                         AKIMOV
             If we switch off LAC, it's possible
             we could get more control...
DYATLOV
             Do it. Go!
Akimov rushes back to Toptunov.
                         AKIMOV
             Disable local automatic control, go
             to global...
Toptunov hesitates, nervous--
Leonid.
AKIMOV
32.
 Right. Okay. Toptunov turns a series of switches. Presses
some buttons.
                         TOPTUNOV
             LAC disabled. Global control
             activated.
Everyone raises their head to:
THE DISPLAY: 500... 440... 260... 220... Toptunov backs away from the panel in disbelief.
                         DYATLOV
             What did you do?
                         TOPTUNOV
             I did what you said! I switched--
                         DYATLOV
             LOOK AT IT!
THE DISPLAY: 110... 75... 55...

                         AKIMOV
             I don't understand....
THE DISPLAY: 35... 32... 30... and then holds.
                         DYATLOV
             You fucking amateurs. You stalled
             the reactor. HOW THE FUCK DID YOU
             GET THIS JOB?
Toptunov puts his head in his hands. He looks like he's
about to cry. Akimov turns back to Dyatlov.
Comrade--
AKIMOV
                         DYATLOV
             You're going to tell me you did
             everything right again, you
             incompetent arsehole?
Akimov slumps. It's over.
                         AKIMOV
             I apologize for this unsatisfactory
result.
"Unsatisfactory result?" The phrase only serves to disgust
Dyatlov even further.
Akimov turns back to the panel.
                         DYATLOV
             What are you doing?
Akimov look at Dyatlov. Isn't it obvious?
                         AKIMOV
             We have to shut it all the way down.
Dyatlov is staring intently at him, but he's now strangely
calm, which is somehow worse.
DYATLOV
No.
But... we're in a xenon pit. We have
to shut down, wait 24 hours--
      AKIMOV
(what?)
33.

            DYATLOV
No. We're doing the test tonight.
Raise the power to 700.
         AKIMOV
We can't increase power from
here. The rules...!
         AKIMOV
If we fall from 80% of
power, we can't increase--
         AKIMOV
From fifty percent is worse!
         DYATLOV
Don't talk to me about
rules.
         DYATLOV
No, no-- we fell from 50% of
power.
         DYATLOV
The rules don't say 50.
There is no rule.
                         AKIMOV
             Comrade Dyatlov, I apologize, but
             what you're saying makes no sense.
                         DYATLOV
             Raise the power.
Akimov looks down. Nerves rising. Dyatlov has gone too far.
AKIMOV
             No.
Dyatlov can't believe it. He almost admires Akimov's gall.
                         AKIMOV
             I won't do it. It isn't safe.
Toptunov straightens next to Akimov. Backing him up.
Dyatlov walks slowly toward them. Calm. Nodding, as if
considering their words. The other men watch in fear.
                         DYATLOV
             Safety first. Always. I've been
             saying that for 25 years. That's how
             long I've done this job. 25 years.
             Is that longer than you, Akimov?
34.
  Yes.
AKIMOV
            DYATLOV
Is it much longer?
Yes.
AKIMOV

     Dyatlov turns to Toptunov.
                              DYATLOV
                  And you? With your mother's tit
                  barely out of your mouth?
     Dyatlov shifts his granite gaze between them as he speaks.
                              DYATLOV
                  If I say it's safe, it's safe. If
                  the two of you disagree... you don't
                  have to work here. And you won't.
                  But not just here. You won't work at
                  Kursk. Or Ignalina. Or Leningrad, or
                  Novo-Voronezh. You won't work
                  anywhere ever again. I'll see to it.
                  I think you know-- I will see to it.
                        (beat)
                  Raise the power.
The room is silent. The display still reads 30. No one says a word. Then... Akimov picks up a LOG BOOK from the panel. Hands it to Dyatlov.
                              AKIMOV
                  I would like you to record your
                  command into the--
     Dyatlov SLAPS it from Akimov's hand. It falls to the floor.
                              DYATLOV
                  Raise the power.
     Dyatlov returns to his desk in the center of the room.
     Akimov takes a long, slow breath, then turns to Toptunov.
     They've lost. What other choice remains?
                              AKIMOV
                  Together, then.
     Toptunov nods. All right. Together. They move their hands
     toward the controls, and:
                              DYATLOV (O.S.)
                  I wasn't even there.
535 INT. TRIAL ROOM - DAY 535
     CLOSE ON: Dyatlov. Hair thinner, moustache weaker... but in
     his eyes, the same burning anger.
35.
 
                                                         36.
Legasov looks back from his board. Did he hear that right?
What?
LEGASOV
                         DYATLOV
             I wasn't in the room when they
             raised the power.
                         LEGASOV
             If you weren't in the room, then
             where were you?
Stepashin rises. Annoyed. At Legasov.
                         STEPASHIN
             Comrade Legasov, you are a witness,
             not a prosecutor. I will ask the
             questions here.
Legasov backs off. Chastened. Of course. This is a show.
Play your role and no other.
Stepashin turns to Dyatlov.
                         STEPASHIN
             If you weren't in the room, then
             where were you?
Dyatlov shifts his eyes away from his interrogator. Shrugs.
                         DYATLOV
             The toilet.
                         STEPASHIN
             The toilet. Comrade Khomyuk
             interviewed everyone who was in the
             control room that night. They all
             told the same story.
Stepashin picks up a packet of typed transcripts. Flips
through the pages, then reads:
                         STEPASHIN
             "I knew what Dyatlov ordered was
             wrong, but if I didn't do what he
             said, I would be fired." Leonid
             Toptunov, one day before he died.
             No, Comrade Dyatlov, you were in the
             room. You ordered them to raise the
             power. This is a fact.
      
Scherbina suddenly starts COUGHING. He gets up, and moves swiftly to the back of the room. Can't make it stop.
And as if that reminded Stepashin they've been at this for hours-- he checks his watch, then nods to the Judge. Fine. Call a recess. It's clear who's really in charge here.
                              JUDGE KADNIKOV
                  Court is now in recess. Thirty
                  minutes.
     Kadnikov RISES, everyone else rises in turn, and we cut to:
536 EXT. CITY OF CHERNOBYL - PARK - LATER 536
     An inept imitation statue of MICKEY MOUSE smiles
     grotesquely through peeling paint.
     The small park is just dust and dead grass now. A rusty
     swing set. A jungle gym.
     ON LEGASOV - across the street. Behind him in the near
     distance, a small gathering of trialgoers on recess are
     clustered. Smoking.
     He sees ahead of him... the back of a man sitting on a
     bench, alone, in the park. Another cough.
     SHCHERBINA - sits on the bench, staring out at the late
     afternoon sun. Legasov takes a seat next to him.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  Do you know anything about this
                  town? Chernobyl?
                              LEGASOV
                  Not really. No.
                              SHCHERBINA
                  It was mostly Jews and Poles. The
                  Jews were killed in pogroms, Stalin
                  forced out the Poles, then the Nazis
                  came and murdered whoever was left.
                        (looks around)
                  But after the war, people came here
                  to live anyway. They knew the ground
                  beneath their feet was soaked in
                  blood, but they didn't care. Dead
                  Jews, dead Poles, but not them. No
                  one ever thinks it will happen to
                  them. But here we are.
37.

Shcherbina shows Legasov his handkerchief. It's mottled with blood.
                         LEGASOV
             How much time?
                         SHCHERBINA
             Maybe a year. They're calling it a
             "long illness." That doesn't seem
             very long to me. I know-- you told
             me. I believed you. At first. But--
             time passed, and I didn't think it
             would happen to me.
                   (beat)
             I wasted it. I wasted it all. For
             nothing.
LEGASOV For nothing?
Shcherbina puts his hand up. Don't.
                         SHCHERBINA
             Do you remember the morning I first
             called you? Do you remember how
             unconcerned I was? I don't believe
             much that comes out of the Kremlin,
             but when they told me they were
             putting me in charge of the cleanup,
             and they said it wasn't serious, I
             believed them. Do you know why?
Legasov doesn't want to answer. But:
                         LEGASOV
             Because they put you in charge.
Shcherbina nods. Of course Legasov knows. Everyone knows.
                         SHCHERBINA
             I am an inconsequential man, Valera.
             That's all I've ever been. I hoped
             one day that I would matter. But I
             didn't.
                   (turns to Legasov)
             I just stood next to people who did.
Legasov stares back in disbelief.
                         LEGASOV
             There are other scientists like me.
             Any one of them could have done what
             I did. But you--
38.
  (MORE)

                              LEGASOV (cont'd)
                        (beat)
Everything we asked for, everything we needed. Men. Material. Lunar rovers? Who else could have done these things? They heard me, but they listened to you. Of all the ministers and all the deputies-- the entire congregation of obedient fools-- they mistakenly sent us the one good man.
                        (beat)
                  For god's sake, Boris-- you were the
                  one who mattered the most.
     Shcherbina is overwhelmed. And here and now, in a forgotten
     park, in a dead city... absolution.
     He looks back through tears at the land. The sky. His
     country. The air fills his lungs.
SHCHERBINA It is beautiful...
537 INT. TRIAL ROOM - LATER 537
     The crowd filters back in, including Legasov and
     Shcherbina. They return to the expert witness table, where
     Khomyuk is waiting.
Khomyuk sees the change on Legasov's face. Something has moved in him. She sees him look back once again to make sure that The Six are still there in the audience.
     Then EVERYONE RISES as the JUDGES return and take their
     seats. Kadnikov nods to Stepashin, who turns to Legasov.
                              STEPASHIN
                  Comrade Legasov.
     Legasov walks back to the whiteboard. There's purpose in
     his step now. His voice is stronger.
                              LEGASOV
                  The time is 38 past midnight. The
                  reactor is nearly shut down, but the
                  operators of Reactor 4 are locked on
                  a path that leads directly to
                  disaster. There is no way to turn
                  back. They do not yet know it, but
                  the die is cast.
39.
  
40. Legasov picks up a BLUE PLACARD. A second "Xenon Poisoning"
(B5) card. He adds it to the board.
                         LEGASOV
             At 30 megawatts, xenon is still being
             created, but none of it is burning
             away. The reactor is drowning in
             poison. To make matters worse--
--he REMOVES the bottom two red placards, "Positive Void Coefficent" (R2) and "Nuclear Fission" (R3).
                         LEGASOV
             --the reactor isn't hot enough to
             produce sufficient steam.
THE BOARD: One red placard, five large blue ones.
                         LEGASOV
             The only way to safely raise power
from this state is to do it very, very slowly over the course of 24 hours. But Dyatlov wants it done now. Akimov and Toptunov have only one course of action. They begin pulling control rods out. Dozens at a time. Halfway out, three quarters of the way out, and the power still does not budge. So they begin to pull them all the way out.
                   (beat)
             There were 211 control rods in
             Reactor 4. Akimov and Toptunov
             completely withdrew 205.
Legasov REMOVES the first blue placard - "Control Rods" (B1).
                         LEGASOV
             Remember... control rods are the
             brakes of this car. Of 211 rods,
             only six now remain in the reactor.
             As for the fuel--
Legasov REMOVES another blue placard - "Negative Temperature Coefficient" (B3).
                         LEGASOV
             --it's gone cold, so the negative
             temperature coefficient is no longer
             weighing down the reactivity.
(MORE)
    
                              LEGASOV (cont'd)
                        (beat)
                  And even still-- the xenon poisoning
                  is so strong, the best they can do
                  is raise the power to 200 megawatts.
     Turns back to the room once more.
                              LEGASOV
                  The control rods are out. The
                  emergency system is disconnected.
                  The reactor is now a grenade without
                  a pin, and the only thing keeping it
                  in check is water... and xenon. It
                  is 1 in the morning. The test is
                  minutes away.
538 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - NIGHT 538
AKIMOV - punches buttons. Flips some switches. Constantly moving his eyes back and forth between the console and the LED POWER OUTPUT display, which holds at 200.
     He slumps. Turns back to Dyatlov, who sits at the desk in
     the center of the room, casually smoking.
                              AKIMOV
                  I'm sorry, but this is all we can
                  get. 200 megawatts. We've pulled
                  almost everything out.
     Dyatlov exhales slowly. Thinks. Then:
                              DYATLOV
                  Well, if that's what we have, that's
what we have.
                              AKIMOV
                  But the test requires 700--
                              DYATLOV
                        (ignores Akimov)
                  Stolyarchuk, let's get ready. Switch
                  on pump four.
                              AKIMOV
                  Wait a second--
                              DYATLOV
                  Stolyarchuk!
     Stolyarchuk hesitates.
41.

                         AKIMOV
             We barely have any steam as it is.
             The turbine is going too slow for
             the test to deliver valid--
                         DYATLOV
             It's enough.
AKIMOV
--and if we add more water, there
will be even less steam--
                         DYATLOV
             I SAID IT'S ENOUGH. I know what I'm
             doing. Stolyarchuk.
Stolyarchuk relents, and hits switches while Kirschenbaum
watches-- utterly confused by this course of action.
                         STOLYARCHUK
             Main Pump 4 is connected. We should
             warn Khodemchuk... the pipes are
             going to be jumping.
                         DYATLOV
             Never mind him. Kirschenbaum--
But he's cut off by: AN ALARM - bleating from the panel. Dyatlov puts his hands up. What now?
                         STOLYARCHUK
             The steam in the separator drum is
             too low-- five atmospheres...
                         DYATLOV
             All right, let's all help him. Get
             it up as best you can.
Stolyarchuk mutters to himself.
                         STOLYARCHUK
             We should stop.
                         DYATLOV
                   (yells)
             And turn that fucking thing off!
Akimov moves to another panel. Flips some override switches. The alarm CEASES. Dyatlov checks the display. Still 200. Now he looks at the clock. 1:07.
                         DYATLOV
             You have fifteen minutes.
42.
 
     Akimov, Toptunov, Kirschenbaum and Stolyarchuk work on the
     panels, trying to get the steam back in balance.
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  Fifteen minutes.
539 INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW 539
     Legasov stands by the board.
                              LEGASOV
                  They might as well have had fifteen
                  days. The problem they were facing
                  was not solvable. The power was too
                  low. The water was too high. The
                  test was already ruined. The results
                  would have been useless. But Dyatlov
                  didn't care. All he wanted to do was
                  report a completed test.
                        (beat)
                  1:22. Less than two minutes remain.
540 INT. REACTOR #4 FACILITY - VARIOUS - 1:22 AM 540

                  Perevozchenko, reactor section

                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  Degtaryenko...
     Viktor looks across the room at:
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  ...and Khodemchuk, circulation
operators, are in the pump room. Khodemchuk gives Viktor a baffled look. What is this?
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  None of them have been told about
                  the test. None of them know what is
                  about to happen.
541 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:22:30 541
     Toptunov stands by a large DOT-MATRIX PRINTER as it slowly
     ejects a sheet of data.
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  1:22 and 30 seconds. Toptunov sees a
                  report from the reactor's SKALA
                  computer system. Based on the
                  absence of sufficient control rods,
                  the computer is recommending the
                  reactor be shut down.
     Toptunov hands the printout to Akimov, who reads it, frets,
     then hands it to Dyatlov. Dyatlov doesn't take it. Just
     looks at it. Barely.
                              DYATLOV
                  Of course it's saying that. It
                  doesn't know we're running a test.
                        (oddly cheerful)
                  All right boys. Another few minutes,
                  and it will all be over.
                  Kirschenbaum, when you're ready?
     Kirschenbaum turns back to his panel. Deep breath. Akimov
     and Toptunov walk back to their panels. Toptunov looks over
     at Akimov. Akimov doesn't look back. Just:
                              AKIMOV
                  We did everything right.
     Kirschenbaum reaches for a switch. Then:
44.

                              KIRSCHENBAUM
                  Oscillograph on. Closing Number 8
                  throttle valve.
                              STOLYARCHUK
                  Generator rotor beginning rundown.
542 INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW 542
     Legasov is staring at the room. It's dead quiet.
                              LEGASOV
                  1:23 and four seconds. With every
                  decision, they have pulled this
                  reactor back like a slingshot...
                  further than anyone has ever pulled.
                        (beat)
                  The test begins. The pumps are shut
                  down.
                        (opens his fist)
                  And they let go.
Legasov moves to the board. On the right, the single red "Nuclear Fission" card (R1). On the left, blue "Water" (B2) and "Xenon Poisoning" (B4, B5). He removes the "Water" (B2) placard.
                              LEGASOV
                  The pumps stop moving water through
                  the reactor. The uranium fuel is now
                  unchecked by fresh coolant.
                  Unchecked by control rods. The
                  balance immediately swings in the
                  opposite direction. In less than a
                  second, reactivity increases.
543 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:23:05 543
45.
    The operators watch their panels. None of them notice the power output display. 205... 210... 220...
544  INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW
                              LEGASOV
                  Inside the core, the remaining water
                  is quickly converting to steam. A
                  void is being created. There is no
                  fresh water to replace it.
544

As he speaks, he adds multiple RED PLACARDS to the right column. "Positive Void Coefficient" (R2), "Nuclear Fission" (R3), "Positive Void Coefficient" (R4), "Nuclear Fission" (R5).
                              LEGASOV
                  Steam increases reactivity increases
                  heat increases steam increases
                  reactivity. The fuel is too cold to
                  counter the vicious cycle. The
                  remaining xenon decays away.
Legasov removes both blue "Xenon Poisoning" placards (B4, B5). There are NONE on the left side now. And five RED ones on the right.
                              LEGASOV
                  The power is rising. And nothing
                  left to stop it. 1:23 and 35
                  seconds...
545 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:23:35 545
Akimov and Toptunov watch the panel. Then Toptunov notices:
LIGHTS blinking on, one after another in quick succession
on the large CIRCULAR FUEL CHANNEL display.
Oh god. He looks up at the power output display.
320... 360... 400...
                         TOPTUNOV
             We have a power surge! Sasha!
Everyone turns at once to look at the power output.
440... 500...
            DYATLOV
      (in shock)
What did you-- ?
546  INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW
     CLOSE ON LEGASOV.
                              LEGASOV
                  1:23 and 40 seconds. The power is
                  surging. The men in Control Room 4
                  have only one option left.

                         LEGASOV (cont'd)
             In every control room of every
             nuclear reactor in the world, there
             is a button with one single
             purpose-- to "scram" or instantly
             shut down the reaction. In Soviet
             reactors, that button is called "AZ-
             5". You press AZ-5, all of the
             control rods insert at once, and the
             reaction is stopped dead.
(beat) But.
He stops. Glances over at Khomyuk, who knows that the
moment is almost upon them. Then the SIX SCIENTISTS.
And Khomyuk realizes-- he's going to do it. He's finally going to tell the truth. But before he can say a word:
                         DYATLOV
             What are you waiting for Legasov?
             Tell your lies.
A hushed gasp from the room. Legasov turns in disbelief to
the defendant BOX, where Dyatlov glares back at him.
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Comrade Dyatlov, you will not be
             warned again.
Or what?
DYATLOV
                         BRYUKHANOV
                   (shut up!)
             For god's sake, Dyatlov--
                         DYATLOV
             Legasov's already given it away. He
             said before there was no way to
             avoid what was coming. He knows
             something.
                   (points to Khomyuk)
             She knows something.
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Strike that from the record.
Dyatlov rises, jabbing his finger toward a stunned Legasov.
                         DYATLOV
             I know what you are, Valery
             Alexeyevich. You're a liar. You're a
             liar and a coward.
47.
 
The soldiers grab Dyatlov's arms to pull him away, but:
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             We've heard enough for today. The
             defendants will be remanded to
             custody. Court will--
Legasov finds his voice.
                         LEGASOV
             I haven't finished.
Stepashin turns his dark gaze on Legasov. How dare he?
                         LEGASOV
             I have more evidence to give.
Shcherbina leans forward. Impossible for us to tell what
he's thinking...
                         STEPASHIN
             It is not necessary. Your testimony
             is concluded.
                   (to Kadnikov)
Your honor.
Legasov deflates. Turns back to Khomyuk. He tried. He tried
to do the right thing.
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Court is now adjourned. We will
             resume tomorrow with--
Shcherbina rises. That wonderful, terrible look in his
eyes. The last stand of the stubborn, impossible Ukrainian.
                         SHCHERBINA
             The trial continues.
Judge Kadnikov begins to sweat. This is different. He looks
at Stepashin, who falters.
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Comrade Shcherbina--
                         SHCHERBINA
             Let him finish.
Stepashin is outranked. He glances at the CAMERAS. The dead faces of the "press." The audience. KGB scattered among them, no doubt. The show must go on. He gestures to Legasov. Very well. It's your funeral.
48.
 
Shcherbina nods to Legasov. He knows what Legasov has decided to do. If we go down, we go down together. Legasov nods back. Gratitude.
     Now he looks out into the audience. There are the SIX
     SCIENTISTS. Listening intently. Almost as if they, too,
     know the choice he is about to make.
                              LEGASOV
                  Dyatlov broke every rule we have,
                  and pushed a reactor to the brink of
                  destruction. He did these things
                  believing there was a fail-safe. AZ-
                  5. A simple button to shut it all
                  down.
                        (beat)
                  But in the circumstance he created--
                  there wasn't. The shut-down system
                  had a fatal flaw.
     Dyatlov listens in stunned horror. What did they not tell
     him? What did he not know?
                              LEGASOV
                  At 1:23 and 40 seconds, Akimov
                  engages AZ-5.
547 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:23:40 547
     Akimov flips the cover off the AZ-5 switch and PRESSES IT.
548  INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW
                              LEGASOV
                  The fully-withdrawn control rods
                  begin moving back into the reactor.
                  These rods are made of boron, which
                  reduces reactivity. But not their
                  tips. The tips are made of graphite,
                  which accelerates reactivity.
                              JUDGE KADNIKOV
                        (disbelief)
Why?
                              LEGASOV
                  Why? For the same reason our
                  reactors do not have containment
                  buildings around them like those in
the West.

                              LEGASOV (cont'd)
                  The same reason we don't use
                  properly enriched fuel in our cores.
                  The same reason we are the only
                  nation that builds water-cooled
                  graphite moderated reactors with a
                  positive void coefficient.
                        (beat)
                  It's cheaper.
     Legasov turns back to the room. And to his jury.
                              LEGASOV
                  The first part of the rods that
                  enter the core are the graphite
                  tips. And when they do, the reaction
                  in the core, which had been rising--
                  now skyrockets. Every last molecule
                  of liquid water instantly converts
                  to steam, which expands and ruptures
                  a series of fuel rod channels.
                        (beat)
                  The control rods in those channels
                  can move no further. The tips are
                  fixed in position, endlessly
                  accelerating the reaction.
     He lets it sink in.
                              LEGASOV
                  Chernobyl reactor 4 is now a nuclear
bomb.

                  1:23 and 42 seconds.
549 INT. REACTOR HALL - 1:23:42 549
     Perevozchenko is in the observation room, making notes on a
     clipboard. He hears a terrible CLUNKING and HISSING.
     He looks out through the window, and his jaw drops.
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  Perevozchenko looks down on the
                  enormous steel lid of the reactor,
                  and sees the impossible.
     THE LID - DOZENS of individual STEEL SQUARES are JOSTLING
     UP AND DOWN like popcorn... now more of them. And MORE.

                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  The fuel channel caps, which each
                  weigh 350 kilograms, are jumping up
                  and down.
Perevozchenko DROPS his clipboard in horror, and RUNS out of the room onto the catwalk... racing for the stairs...
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  The pressure required to do this is
                  unimaginable. He runs to warn the
                  control room.
     Perevozchenko half runs, half falls down the catwalks
     stairs, scrambles back to his feet, and keeps running.
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  But there's nothing he can do to
                  stop what is coming. 1:23:44.
550 INT. PUMP ROOM - 1:23:44 550
     KHODEMCHUK backs away from the pumps. They are ROCKING in
     place... valves begin to POP OFF like BULLETS...
551 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:23:44 551
Akimov's hand is still on the AZ-5 button. But the LED DISPLAY is climbing. 700... 1000... 1800...
     ON THE PANEL - hundreds of indicators and meters LIGHT UP
     at once.
                              LEGASOV (V.O.)
                  The steam blows more fuel channels
                  apart. We do not know how high the
                  power went. We only know the final
                  reading. Reactor #4, designed to
                  operate at 3200 megawatts--
Akimov and Toptunov look up at THE LED DISPLAY as it jumps... from 1800 to-- 4800 ... 9280... 12700... 24720...
552  INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW
                              LEGASOV

                  At long last-- we have arrived.
                  1:23:45. Explosion.
553 INT. REACTOR HALL - 1:23:45 553
EXPLOSION - a thunderous BLAST of SUPERHEATED VAPOR erupts from the core. The massive STEEL REACTOR LID is BLOWN UP and TO THE SIDE... like the open lid of a tin can.
     The shockwave PUNCHES THROUGH THE CEILING, sending concrete
     and glass into the night...
554 INT. JUST OUTSIDE THE REACTOR HALL - CONTINUOUS 554
     Perevozchenko is THROWN to the ground. He turns back,
     and... horror.
555 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - CONTINUOUS 555
A deep THUD echoes through the room. Everyone ducks a bit... looking around... what the fuck was that?
556 INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW 556
     CLOSE ON LEGASOV - retelling the story as if he lived
     through it. In his mind... he has.
                              LEGASOV
                  In the instant the lid is thrown off
                  the reactor, oxygen rushes in. It
                  combines with hydrogen and
                  superheated graphite.
557 INT. REACTOR HALL - 1:23:47 557
     A rush of air, and a terrible crackling as the gases inside
     the core ignite, and:
558 INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW 558
                              LEGASOV
                  The chain of disaster-- is complete.
559 EXT. REACTOR #4 BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 559 CATACLYSM

     --as the true power of the atom is finally released. In an
     instant, the building becomes a VOLCANO. Nuclear forces
     explode up and out, and turn NIGHT INTO DAY.
     A PLUME of DEBRIS is sent ROCKETING 1,000 METERS INTO THE
     AIR, as if shot from the center of the earth itself.
560 EXT. REACTOR BUILDING - C0NTINUOUS 560
     A HAILSTORM of BURNING GRAPHITE comes raining down from the
     plume... and as the last bits of deadly debris clatter back
     to the surrounding roof and ground...
     ...a thin BLUE LIGHT materializes in the air, shining
     straight up and down between the open reactor and the sky,
     piercing through the choking black smoke.
     The BLUE LIGHT widens... a color we were never meant to
     know... a glowing column connecting the earth and heavens.
     A trillion atoms set free. Death, the destroyer of worlds.
561 INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 1:24 AM 561
     No sound except distant hissing noises. All we see is
     SWIRLING WHITE DUST, illuminated by emergency BACKUP
     LIGHTS. And now we make out:
     The operators. Cowering. All except for Dyatlov.
     CLOSE ON DYATLOV - SLOW MOTION - the white dust swirls
     eerily around his face. He's bewildered. Shell-shocked.
     We hear a voice echoing as if from far away:
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                  Comrade Dyatlov? Comrade Dyatlov?
DISSOLVE TO:
562 INT. TRIAL ROOM - NOW 562
     DYATLOV, NOW - thinner and terribly older... but the
     expression is the same. Shell-shocked.
                              LEGASOV
                  No one in the room that night knew
                  the shut-down button could act as a
                  detonator. They didn't know it--
                  because it was kept from them.
53.
 
The six scientists listen in shock. A rare thing in the
air, the sound of truth...
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Comrade Legasov-- you are
             contradicting--
                   (searches documents)
             You are contradicting your own
             testimony in Vienna--
                         LEGASOV
             My testimony in Vienna was a lie. I
lied. To the world.
ON KHOMYUK - a mixture of disbelief and gratitude. At last,
someone has spoken the truth.
                         LEGASOV
             I am not the only one who kept this
             secret. There are many. We were
             following orders. From the KGB, from
             the Central Committee. And right
             now, there are 16 reactors in the
             Soviet Union with this same fatal
             flaw. Three of them are still
             running less than 20 kilometers
             away... at Chernobyl.
Kadnikov is frightened by Legasov's words. But he too has
his orders. He too is at risk. And this is not the
narrative over which he was meant to preside.
                         JUDGE KADNIKOV
             Professor Legasov, if you mean to
             suggest the Soviet State is somehow
             responsible for what happened, then
             I must warn you-- you are treading
             on dangerous ground.
                         LEGASOV
             I've already trod on dangerous
             ground. We're on dangerous ground
             right now. Because of our secrets
             and our lies. They are practically
             what defines us. When the truth
             offends, we lie and lie until we
             cannot even remember it's there. But
             it is still there. Every lie we tell
             incurs a debt to the truth.
                   (beat)
             Sooner or later, the debt is paid.
54.
   
     Legasov turns back to the six scientists. His colleagues.
     His peers. His secret jury. His hope.
                              LEGASOV
                  That is how an RBMK reactor core
explodes.
(beat) Lies.
     And one by one, the scientists look down or avert their
     eyes. Ashamed. Or frightened. Or in denial. It doesn't
     matter which.
Legasov can tell from their faces. So can Khomyuk. It didn't work. It wasn't enough. They've failed.
It's over.
563 INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 563
Legasov walks down the hallway that leads away from the trial room. One of the ARMED SOLDIERS-- who had been guarding the defendants-- now walks behind Legasov. Guarding him.
     They arrive at a DOOR. The soldier says nothing. Just
     gestures to the door.
     Legasov opens it, and walks into:
564 INT. FACILITY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 564
     A large facility kitchen designed to supply catering for
     the building. Or it once was. Now it's mostly empty, save
     for a few scattered folding chairs.
Legasov takes a step into the room, then stops. Looks down. There's a small DRAIN set in the floor. So. This is where he dies. In an abandoned kitchen of an abandoned city in an abandoned land. He closes his eyes.
BOOM.
     The echoey thud of the DOOR behind him. The soldier has
     left. Legasov is alone. He finds his breath, and we
     DISSOLVE to:
565 OMITTED 565
55.
  
566 INT. FACILITY KITCHEN - LATER 566
     The door opens. CHARKOV enters. He closes the door behind
     him, and takes a seat across from Legasov.
     He reaches into his coat pocket. Removes a piece of paper.
     Unfolds it. Puts on his glasses to read.
                              CHARKOV
                  Valery Alexeyevich Legasov. Son of
                  Alexei Legasov, Head of Ideological
                  Compliance, Central Committee.
                        (looks up)
                  You know what your father did there?
A long pause.
             Yes.
LEGASOV
Yes.
Yes.
LEGASOV
LEGASOV
Yes.
As a student, you had a leadership
position in Komsomol. Communist
Youth. Correct?
            LEGASOV
You already know--
            CHARKOV
Answer the question.
      CHARKOV
(continues reading)
            CHARKOV
At the Kurchatov Institute, you were
the Communist Party secretary. In
that position, you limited the
promotion of Jewish scientists.
            CHARKOV
To curry favor with Kremlin
officials?
This is how they break you. With the sins of your father.
With your own.
56.

Charkov sighs. Puts the paper away.
                         CHARKOV
             You're one of us, Legasov. You've
             always been one of us. I can do
             anything I want with you, anything,
             but what I want the most is for you
             to know that I know. You're not
             brave. You're not heroic.
                   (beat)
             You're just a dying man who forgot
             himself.
Legasov looks down. No.
                         LEGASOV
             I know who I am, and I know what
             I've done. In a just world, I would
             be shot for my lies.
                   (beat)
             But not for this. Not for the truth.
                         CHARKOV
             Scientists... and your idiot
             obsession with reasons.
                   (leans in)
When the bullet hits your skull, what will it matter why?
A grim moment. Then-- Charkov smiles. Leans back.
                         CHARKOV
             No one's getting shot, Legasov. The
             whole world saw you in Vienna. It
             would be embarrassing to kill you
             now. And for what? Your testimony
             today will not be accepted by the
             State. It will not be disseminated
             in the press. It never happened.
                   (beat)
             No, you will live-- however long you
             have. But not as a scientist. Not
             anymore. You'll keep your title and
             your office, but no duties, no
             authority, no friends. No one will
             talk to you. No one will listen to
             you. Other men-- lesser men-- will
             receive credit for the things you
             have done. Your legacy is now their
             legacy. You'll live long enough to
             see that.
57.
      Erased. He's being erased. Before he can speak--

                         CHARKOV
             What role did Shcherbina play in
this?
                         LEGASOV
             None. He didn't know what I was
going to say.
                         CHARKOV
             What role did Khomyuk play in this?
                         LEGASOV
             None. She didn't know either.
Charkov stares into Legasov's eyes. He sees no waver, no
blink, no false bravado. He wasn't expecting that.
                         CHARKOV
             After all you've said and done
             today, it would be-- curious-- if
             you chose this moment to lie.
                         LEGASOV
                   (unfaltering)
             I would think a man of your
             experience would know a lie when he
             hears one.
A long pause, as Charkov passes silent judgment. Then... he
nods. Very well. He believes. But:
                         CHARKOV
             You will not meet or communicate
             with either one of them ever again.
             You will not communicate with anyone
             about Chernobyl ever again. You will
             remain so immaterial to the world
             around you that when you finally do
             die, it will be exceedingly hard to
             tell that you ever lived at all.
                         LEGASOV
             And if I refuse?
Charkov's eyes deaden. The face of a murderer. Then, as if
by the flip of a switch, an amiable shrug.
                         CHARKOV
             Why worry about something that isn't
             going to happen?
And Valery Legasov, as dead as a living man can be, can't
help but smile at that.
58.
   
                              LEGASOV
                  "Why worry about something that
                  isn't going to happen." That's
                  perfect.
                        (beat)
                  They should put that on our money.
567 EXT. CITY OF CHERNOBYL - STREET - BEFORE SUNSET 567
     The front door of the building opens. KGB men emerge. They
     walk in unison, surrounding LEGASOV as they escort him.
     Up ahead, a KGB agent waits by a CAR for Legasov. Legasov
     turns back... and there they are, across the street.
     Khomyuk and Shcherbina. Khomyuk fights back tears. She
     knows what he did. She knows why. She knows what it means.
     Legasov knows he can't say a word. All he has is his face,
     his eyes, his heart. He absolves her as best he can.
And now, Shcherbina. His brother. His friend. His rock. Shcherbina raises a hand in goodbye. They don't need words. It happened. They mattered. And now it's over.
     Legasov raises his hand back, then gets into the car. We
     RISE UP - as the car pulls away...
     SOUND: the HISS of an audio tape, and then:
                              LEGASOV (VO ON TAPE)
                  To be a scientist is to be naive. We
                  are so focused on our search for
                  truth, we fail to consider how few
                  actually want us to find it. But it
                  is always there, whether we can see
                  it or not, whether we choose to or
                  not. The truth doesn't care about
                  our needs or wants. It doesn't care
                  about our governments, our
                  ideologies, our religions. It will
                  lie in wait, for all time.
     We RISE UP HIGHER - as the car disappears down the road.
                              LEGASOV (VO ON TAPE)
                  And this, at last, is the gift of
                  Chernobyl. Where I once would fear
                  the cost of truth, now I only ask:
CUT TO BLACK:
59.
 
568 OVER BLACK 568
                              LEGASOV (VO ON TAPE)
                  What is the cost of lies?
569 INT./EXT. THE REAL PRIPYAT - TODAY 569
     MUSIC: Vichnaya Pamyat (Eternal Memory)
     Photos of Valery Legasov...
          Valery Legasov took his own life at the age of 51
                 on April 26, 1988, exactly two years
                  after the explosion at Chernobyl.
         The audio tapes of Legasov's memoirs were circulated
                among the Soviet scientific community.
        His suicide made it impossible for them to be ignored.
       In the aftermath of his death, Soviet officials finally
     acknowledged the design flaws of the RBMK nuclear reactors.
             Those reactors were immediately retrofitted
     to prevent an accident like Chernobyl from happening again.
     Photographs of various scientists who participated in the
     battle to clean up Chernobyl...
              Legasov was aided by dozens of scientists
          who worked tirelessly alongside him at Chernobyl.
        Some spoke out against the official account of events
      and were subject to denunciation, arrest and imprisonment.
              The character of Ulana Khomyuk was created
                  to represent them all and to honor
         their dedication and service to truth and humanity.
     Photographs of Shcherbina...
             Boris Shcherbina died on August 22, 1990...
      four years and four months after he was sent to Chernobyl.
     Images from the actual trial...
              For their roles in the Chernobyl disaster,
         Viktor Bryukhanov, Anatoly Dyatlov and Nikolai Fomin
               were sentenced to ten years hard labor.
         After his release, Nikolai Fomin returned to work...
             at a nuclear power plant in Kalinin, Russia.

The final photo taken of Dyatlov, hunched over, thin, bald.
Anatoly Dyatlov died from radiation-related illness in 1995.
                         He was 64.

       Valery Khodemchuk's body was never recovered.
        He is permanently entombed under Reactor 4.
EXISTING FOOTAGE: handheld video of someone in a protective
suit moving through the dark, dilapidated hallways...
The firefighters' clothing still remains in the basement of Pripyat Hospital.
VIDEO: a dosimeter is held near one of the firefighter's
actual boots. The beeping turns into one long, loud alarm.
         It is dangerously radioactive to this day.
Abandoned rooms in Pripyat...
      Following the death of her husband and daughter,
       Lyudmilla Ignatenko suffered multiple strokes.
 Doctors told her she would never be able to bear a child.
                      They were wrong.
              She lives with her son in Kiev.
The actual railway bridge...
     Of the people who watched from the railway bridge,
          it has been reported that none survived.
         It is now known as "The Bridge of Death."
Photos of the miners...
      400 miners worked around the clock for one month
            to prevent a total nuclear meltdown.
         It is estimated that at least 100 of them
                 died before the age of 40.
Photos of the interior of damaged reactor building 4...
     It has been widely reported that the three divers
               who drained the bubbler tanks
         died as a result of their heroic actions.

     In fact, all three survived after hospitalization.
                 Two are still alive today.
Photos of liquidators...
       Over 600,000 people were conscripted to serve
                   in the Exclusion Zone.
     Despite widespread accounts of sickness and death
  as a result of radiation, the Soviet government kept no
              official records of their fate.

      The contaminated region of Ukraine and Belarus,
                known as the Exclusion Zone,
      ultimately encompassed 2,600 square kilometers.

        Approximately 300,000 people were displaced
    from their homes. They were told this was temporary.
              It is still forbidden to return.
Footage of Gorbachev presiding over a Labor Day parade...
      Mikhail Gorbachev presided over the Soviet Union
               until its dissolution in 1991.
  In 2006, he wrote, "The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl...
         was perhaps the true cause of the collapse
                   of the Soviet Union."
We move around the power plant as it exists now. The
reactor building is entirely encased in a metal half-dome.
 In 2017, work was completed on the New Safe Confinement at
     Chernobyl at a cost of nearly two billion dollars.
             It is designed to last 100 years.
EXISTING FOOTAGE: Doctors examine children. Some are
clearly sick.
    Following the explosion, there was a dramatic spike
        in cancer rates across Ukraine and Belarus.
          The highest increase was among children.

 We will never know the actual human cost of Chernobyl.
   Most estimates range from 4,000 to 93,000 deaths.
The official Soviet death toll, unchanged since 1987...
                       ...is 31.

     In memory of all who suffered and sacrificed.
